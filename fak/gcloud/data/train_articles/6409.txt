Miami Dolphins Drop Stadium Tax Appeal!
The Miami Dolphins are scheduled to notify Miami-Dade County tax authorities this morning that they are withdrawing their appeal to lower Sun Life Stadium‘s $3 million tax bill.

After Gossip Extra started making calls to team officials yesterday to ask why they’re maneuvering for a property tax rebate while asking fellow taxpayers to pony up $100 million to renovated their stadium, team spokesman Eric Jotkoff promised that Dolphins lawyers will be withdrawing their petition this morning.

“This appeal was filed in error,” Jotkoff claims. “We never intended for this to go on.”

According to county records Jeffrey Mandler, a lawyer who often works for Fins owner Stephen Ross‘ real estate development company, filed the appeal earlier this year.

He was due to argue for lower taxes before the Value Adjustment Board in late May, according to VAB Manager Robert Alfaro.

Alfaro said the details and legal basis for Mandler’s petition would not be known until his hearing. But Alfaro added that most filings with the VAB claim that government appraisers unfairly assessed a value to a property.

Mandler did not return calls to explain why he filed the challenge.
