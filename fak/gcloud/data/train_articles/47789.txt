How Each House Member Voted on the Tax Bill
WASHINGTON — The House voted 227-203 on Tuesday to pass the Republican tax overhaul bill. The Times tracked how every representative voted, live from the House chamber.

UPDATE The Senate voted on Wednesday to pass the tax bill.

Majority needed to pass Yes No Not voting Republicans 227 12 0 Democrats 0 191 2 Total 227 203 2

Twelve Republicans voted no, and all but one of them were from California, New Jersey or New York. The bill was expected to pass, and now it will head to the Senate. If it passes the Senate, President Trump could then sign the legislation into law.

It would have taken 23 Republican “no” votes for the bill to fail, and only 13 Republicans voted against the original House version of the tax plan. Representative Tom McClintock of California was the only Republican to change his vote to yes on this bill from no on the original House bill. All Democrats were expected to vote no.
