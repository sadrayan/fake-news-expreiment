Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: “If You Don’t Like Our President You Can Leave and Never Come Back Again”
Sandra Bullock says she’s not “politically vocal” but that doesn’t mean she isn’t serious when it comes to America’s leadership.

Miss Congeniality star raises the bar for Hollywood with her standards, but that’s not hard in this town.

“I just want what’s best for our country,” Bullock said during a press conference for her new film, Our Brand Is Crisis, in Los Angeles on Friday

Bullock, who plays Jane “Calamity” Bodine, a political strategist, in the upcoming movie, says her own views are colored by her son Louis.

“I would like my rights represented and those of my son – very selfish views and I think everyone else has them,” she says. “When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good.” To us here at TheTrumpTimes.com this means a lot.

Bullock, who says she’d “do anything” for her son, said this “internal discussion” hinged largely on who else, on a larger scale, would work to represent Louis’ best interests. I guess we could all use a dose of let’s leave a better Country to our kids than we inherited. You know we don’t hear that anymore. It really would be great to go back to some values we seem to have lost.

“What people would still get together and protest for the greater good? Have we all gotten too scared and too safe?” she asked.
