Wis. governor signs bill granting tax cuts
MADISON, Wis. (AP) â€” Wisconsin companies will be getting a small tax break for every new job they add under a bill signed by Gov. Scott Walker.

The governor signed a bill Friday that allows deductions worth between $92 and $316 per job depending on the size of the company and its tax bracket.

The Republican-authored plan will cost $67 million over the next two-year budget, contributing to the state's projected $3.2 billion shortfall.

Walker promised tax cuts for businesses on the campaign trail and introduced the bill as part of his jobs-creation agenda. He hasn't said how he plans to make up the lost revenue, and Democrats have blasted the cuts as too insignificant to stimulate job creation.

Walker says the bill is just one step in his agenda.
