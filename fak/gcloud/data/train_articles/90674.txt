Federal Funding: Federal Entitlement Programs
Federal Entitlement Programs

Federal Entitlement programs, or Formula Funds, are non-competitive funds allocated on the basis of student enrollment. The U.S. Department of Education distributes these funds to State Education Agencies (SEA) that in turn, distribute the funds to Local Education Agencies (LEA) or school districts. Local school districts must allocate the funds to qualifying school campuses based upon student enrollment.

Scholastic's products and services are aligned to these Federal Entitlement programs:

For each of these Federal Entitlement programs, you will find Aligned Scholastic Products, the NCLB Program Reference, and a one-page Program Summary.
