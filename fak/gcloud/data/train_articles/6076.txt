Obama Administration Suing Wisconsin Company for Forcing Employees to Speaking English
This past week the Obama administration filed suit on a private American company for discrimination against Hispanic and Asian employees. Why you ask? Because they don’t want to speak English on the job and it infringes on their rights to choose which language they like to speak.

Most people would give anything to speak fluent English and learn it over a period of time. But in the good ol’ U.S. of A. you can sue people for anything, so this week the Obama administration is assisting a group of Hispanics and Asians to stop a Green Bay, Wisconsin metal and plastics manufacturer for firing a group of employees that refused to speak English.

The U.S. says that this violates section VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the feds came out to say “even though those skills were not needed to perform the jobs, the offense still exists under the law.”

Requirements for speaking fluent English in the workplace are put there to circumvent discrimination laws put in place to protect workers from other countries. The government attorney handling the case says “But superficial appearances are not fooling anyone.”

The attorney in case went on to say, “When speaking English fluently is not, in fact, required for the safe and effective performance of a job, nor for the successful operation of the employer’s business, requiring employees to be fluent in English usually constitutes employment discrimination on the basis of national origin — and thus violates federal law.”

Well people, again, welcome to the new state of the good ol’ U.S. of A. It seems we have become the laughing-stock of the crowd and the Obama administration is feeding the fire to take us down to the lowest level possible.
