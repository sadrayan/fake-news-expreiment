Nike's amazing Ohio State-Oregon photo isn't actually from the game
Just after the start oft he national championship game, this picture of Ohio State and Oregon's captains blew up on social media:

The picture is beautiful. The detail on the coin, mid-flip. The players' rapt attention. How did somebody snap an image that beautiful during the coin toss?

One problem though -- those aren't the players that took the coin toss. Ohio State sent out these four (not three):

And Oregon sent these four:

Here's what the guys at the coin toss actually looked like:

Obviously, the players are wearing different numbers from the ones in the Nike image, and as you'll notice, all the players in the Nike image are wearing visors. It seems probable those are just random people in Ohio State/Oregon jerseys -- Nike can't use active college athletes in its ads, lest they'll lose their eligibility.

To be honest, we probably could've figured this out when none of Ohio State's captains had a single Buckeye sticker on their helmet.

However, the picture *is* a real picture, not a photoshop. So some Nike photographer did manage to capture that beautiful image (perhaps with something hidden holding up the coin, rather than using an actively flipping one.)
