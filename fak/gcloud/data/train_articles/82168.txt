Professional Biography

Emad Atiq teaches contracts, philosophy of law, and ethical theory. His scholarship focuses on the nature of normative thought and talk; and the implications of meta-normative theory for ethics and legal theory.

In recent work, he offers a general account of the differences between normative questions that arise in contract law and tort law, as well as the scope of judicial obligations to follow the law. In previously published work, he has explored the ethics of legal incentives, criticized the influence of folk metaphysics in criminal law, and argued that the difference between legal and moral decision-making is a matter of constitutional significance.

In addition to work in ethics and legal theory, Atiq has interests in general metaphysics and the philosophy of mind and perception. He has published on the nature of metaphysical explanation and has on-going work defending a heterodox version of quasi-realist expressivism about normativity.

His articles have appeared in Philosophical Studies, Ratio, Yale Law Journal, New Criminal Law Review, Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics, & Public Policy, American Criminal Law Review, and the University of Illinois Law Review.
