Alexander Logan Schachter Obituary
Alex Schachter, 14, resided in Parkland, Florida for the last eight years. Alex was tragically killed during the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. He was a sweetheart of a kid! As a freshman, Alex loved the marching band and played the trombone and baritone as part of the Eagle Regiment band - one of the top marching bands in the state of Florida! He is survived by his heartbroken parents, three siblings, grandparents and countless cousins, aunts, uncles and friends. In an effort to continue his memory, this scholarship is being created to help other students experience the joys of music as well as fund increased security at schools. Please help keep Alexâ€™s spirit alive.
