Wisconsin Works for Everyone: 25,000 Gain Employment through the FoodShare Employment and Training Program
According to data issued by the Department of Health Services, more than 25,000 FoodShare members who participated in the FoodShare Employment and Training (FSET) program have secured employment, as of December 2017. As part of Governor Scott Walker’s Wisconsin Works for Everyone reform, the FSET program helps Wisconsin citizens move from government dependence to true independence through the dignity that comes from work.

Data shows that:

Since FSET implemented statewide on April 1, 2015, there have been 25,071 FSET participants who have gained employment.

On average, FSET participants worked an average of 35 hours per week and earned $12.68 per hour – well above the state minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.

In his 2018 State of the State address, Governor Walker proposed expanding the work requirement statewide for able-bodied adults in the FoodShare program, “For those who are able, we will enable them to find meaningful work. We want to help people pursue careers to support themselves and their families.”

Under Governor Scott Walker’s Wisconsin Works for Everyone plan, able-bodied adults in the FoodShare program who do not have children in the home must meet a work requirement. FoodShare members can meet the work requirement by doing any of the following for at least 80 hours per month: working, participating in the FSET program or another eligible worker training program, or a combination of both working and participating in a work program. FSET is also available for FoodShare members who do not need to meet a work requirement, including adults with dependent children, the elderly, and people with disabilities.
