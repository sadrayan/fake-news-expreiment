New York surgeon who treated Bono found dead in Park Avenue apartment in suspected suicide
A top US surgeon is said to have been found dead with a knife in his torso in his New York flat on Sunday in a suspected suicide.

Dr Dean Lorich, 54, worked as Bono’s Orthopaedic trauma surgeon after the U2 frontman fell off his bike in 2014 and required extensive reconstructive surgery. The musician broke his arm in six places and suffered a broken eye socket.

Dr Lorich, the father of three daughters, was the associate director of the Orthopedic Trauma Service at the Hospital for Special Surgery and a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College.

NYPD said police who were answering to an emergency call of an assault in a Park Avenue apartment at 1.05pm on Sunday found Dr Lorich unconscious and unresponsive with a knife in his torso.

During an interview with Rolling Stone magazine back in 2014, Dr Lorich discussed treating Bono, saying: “He was taken emergently to the operating room ... where the elbow was washed out and debrided.

“A nerve trapped in the break was moved and the bone was repaired with three metal plates and 18 screws.”

The Hospital for Special Surgery, New York-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine expressed their sadness about the news via a statement on Sunday evening.

"Dr Lorich was a distinguished orthopaedic trauma surgeon and teacher serving at Hospital for Special Surgery, New York-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine. We mourn this tragic development and extend our deepest sympathies to Dr Lorich's family, friends and patients," they said.
