Trump jokes about ejecting baby from rally
Donald Trump joked today that he wanted a crying baby ejected from his rally in northern Virginia.

Trump, the Republican nominee, was interrupted Tuesday by the wails of a child.

"Don't worry about that baby, I love babies," Trump said. "I hear that baby crying, I like it. What a beautiful baby."

But when the baby continued to cry, Trump followed up by saying "Actually, I was just get kidding â€” you can get that baby out of here!"
