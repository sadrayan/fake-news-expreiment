Gov. Charlie Crist appears ready to veto SB6, the controversial teacher-tenure bill. But on March 25, his education policy chief, Terry Golden, supported the bill as a representative of the "Executive Office of the Governor." Golden filled out an appearance card -- and checked "proponent" -- when the bill was up in Anitere Flores's PreK-12 Education Committee.

The bill passed last week in almost the exact same form as it appeared at that March 25 committee meeting. The only change was an amendment by Sen. Evelyn Lynn to allow principals to take into account advanced degrees in their performance reviews.

Of course, in the intervening time, teachers have come out against the proposal in mass numbers. They're concerned about provisions that tie their pay to student test scores.

"The people are concerned about this," Crist said this morning. "I want to make sure I have every opportunity to listen to my boss, the people, and hear what their thoughts and concerns are."
