DFL-endorsed candidate for Congress
Ilhan's Vision

As a freshman congresswoman, Ilhan is working everyday on our shared progressive, bold agenda — one where we have Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, are rid of the Muslim Ban, have tuition- and debt-free college, an understanding that housing is a human right, and elections and politicians that cannot be bought.

Together we can organize and work to better the lives of Minnesota’s Fifth District and move our state and country forward.
