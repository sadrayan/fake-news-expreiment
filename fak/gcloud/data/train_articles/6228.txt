Water Science Questionnaire #3: Water use at home
Questionnaire #3

How much is your daily indoor water use?

How much water do you use when you take a shower? Wash a load of clothes? Flush a toilet? Even brush your teeth? One important measurement of water use is how much water one person uses in one day, or per-capita water use (per is Latin for by and capita is Latin for head). The number is usually expressed as gallons of water used per person per day.

Fill in this form to get an rough estimate of how much water you use inside your home on a typical day.

To make things consistent, let's take a rainy and cold Saturday when you happen to stay home all day. Think of the water-using activities you do: take a shower, brush your teeth, maybe wash dishes and clothes, etc. In the form below, fill in the boxes with your water-use activities, choose the submit button, and we'll give you an estimate of how many gallons of water you used.

NOTE: Our survey here is very general in nature...just to give you a quick idea of your water use. There are some other Web sites that will give you a much more detailed and accurate estimate of your per-capita water use:
