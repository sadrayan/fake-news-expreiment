Queen Elizabeth wore gift from Obama during Trump meeting
As thousands of people demonstrated against President Trump in the UK, Queen Elizabeth II seemed to make a statement of her own by wearing a brooch given as a gift by former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama.

The Queen donned the American-made, 14-karat yellow gold flower pin during an audience at Windsor Castle the day Trump and the first lady landed in Britain, according to multiple reports.

According to Her Majesty’s Jewel Vault blog, the piece, encrusted with diamonds and moss agate, was selected and personally purchased from the tiny Jewel Box jewelry store in Washington, DC, by Obama and his wife in 2011 and is also known as the “American State Brooch.”

While welcoming Trump for tea, the 92-year-old monarch donned a palm leaf diamond brooch famously worn by her mother at the state funeral for the Queen’s father, King George VI, in 1952.

The day after the meeting, her royal highness wore a sapphire pin in the shape of a snowflake, gifted to her by the Canadian people in 2017 to mark her 65 years on the throne.
