Political Connections Sun: Kathleen Peters vague on budget, abortion
State Rep. Kathleen Peters, running for the Republican nomination to succeed C.W. Bill Young, appears Sunday on Political Connections on Bay News 9 and shows a knack for not answering questions directly. It's sometimes hard to tell if her vague answers on matters ranging to recent Republican U.S. House budgets to accepting billions in federal money to provide insurance to one million Floridians illustrate shrewd evasiveness, lack of knowledge, or both.

Political Connections airs at 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. Sunday. Here's a clip.
