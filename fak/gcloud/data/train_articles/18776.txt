Notes:

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis seasonally adjusts this series by using the 'statsmodel' library from Python with default parameter settings. The package uses the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-13ARIMA-SEATS Seasonal Adjustment Program. More information on the 'statsmodel' X-13ARIMA-SEATS package can be found at https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.x13.x13_arima_analysis.html. More information on X-13ARIMA-SEATS can be found at https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/.



Some seasonally adjusted series may exhibit negative values because they are created from a seasonal adjustment process regardless of the actual meaning or interpretation of the given indicator.
