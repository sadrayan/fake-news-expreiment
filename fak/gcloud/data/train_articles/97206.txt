"Black Friday" (day after Thanksgiving), 1951

Here's another early (post-WWII) use of "Black Friday" to denote the day after Thanksgiving. It's difficult to determine how widespread this 1951/1952 usage was or whether it was just a humorous attempt by an associate editor of *Factory Management and Maintenance* to describe the day after Thanksgiving, a day known for worker absenteeism, but I offer it as a data point. (It's also a little tough to know whether this is related to -- or perhaps whether it influenced -- Philadelphians' "Black Friday," a term used at least as early as the mid-1960s to describe that hectic, headache-filled day of shopping that followed Thanksgiving. See link, far below.) -- Bonnie ------------------------------ WHAT TO DO ABOUT "FRIDAY AFTER THANKSGIVING" "Friday-after-Thanksgiving-itis" is a disease second only to the bubonic plague in its effects. At least that's the feeling of those who have to get production out, when the "Black Friday" comes along. The shop may be half empty, but every absentee was sick -- and can prove it. What to do? Many companies have tried the standard device of denying Thanksgiving Day pay to employees absent the day before and after the holiday. Trouble is, you can't deny pay to those legitimately ill. But what's legitimate? Tough to decide these days of often miraculously easy doctors' certificates. Glenn L. Martin, Baltimore aircraft manufacturer has another solution: When you decide you want to sweeten up the holiday kitty, pick Black Friday to add to the list. That's just what Martin has done. Friday after Thanksgiving is the company's seventh paid holiday. We're not suggesting more paid holidays just to get out of a hole. But, if you can make a good trade in bargaining, there are lots of worse things than having a holiday on a day that was half holiday anyway. Shouldn't cost too much for that reason, either.

Murphy was the Industrial Relations Editor for the magazine; *Factory Management and Maintenance* was published in New York City.] (Murphy again used "Black Friday" in his column for the February, 1952, issue [p. 133]: "November FACTORY [page 137] told of one company's solution to heavy Friday-after-Thanksgiving absenteeism. The company added "Black Friday" to its list of paid holidays."] ------------------------------ "Black Friday," 1966: http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0804D&L=ADS-L&P=R5955 ------------------------------------------------------------ The American Dialect Society - http://www.americandialect.org
