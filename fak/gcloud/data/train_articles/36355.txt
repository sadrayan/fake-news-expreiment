Rule Summary

EPA revised the primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone (O3) to provide protection of public health and welfare in 2008. The revision is based on EPA’s review of the air quality criteria for ozone (O3) and related photochemical oxidants and for O3.

With regard to the primary standard for O3, EPA revised the level of the 8-hour standard to a level of 0.075 parts per million (ppm), to provide increased protection for children and other ‘‘at risk’’ populations against an array of O3- related adverse health effects. With regard to the secondary standard for O3, EPA revised the standard to make it identical to the revised primary standard.
