Smallest cat ever
The smallest cat on record was a male blue point Himalayan-Persian, named Tinker Toy that measured only 7 cm (2.75 in) tall and 19 cm (7.5 in) long when full grown (aged 2.5 years). The unusually tiny feline was owned by Katrina and Scott Forbes (USA) of Taylorville, Illinois, USA.

Tinker Toy was born on 25 December 1990 (the runt of six kittens) and died in November 1997 at the age of six.
