Obama: The Country Is Better Off Because Of Me
During Barack Obama’s final press conference Friday afternoon, he started the conference by patting himself on the back.

Obama told a room full of reporters that after eight years of his presidency, the United States is stronger, in better shape, and more respected across the world than ever before.

“Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago.”

Many people, however, disagree with Obama’s assessment of himself and his job performance. For some, it’s clear that he’s been a disaster for America on a scale that few other presidents can match.

The problems with a number of his policies have many people questioning Obama’s opinion while he jokingly said ‘Thanks Obama‘ for a list of supposed improvements.
