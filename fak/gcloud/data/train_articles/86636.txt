GOP Smacks Gilli and Chuck
BY Michael McAuliff

Republicans don't have a candidate to challenge Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, much less Chuck Schumer, but that doesn't mean their Senate campaign team can't knock them over the tough spot the senators are in, voting for and defending a health care reform bill that's less than perfect.

For Gillibrand, it's the abortion issue and progressive discontent. For Schumer, it's the money New York could be forced to pony up.

Here's the NRSC,'s Brian Walsh, citing[ our story ](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2009/12/23/2009-12-23_whats_up_...)and the[ New York Post's](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gilly_nd_opinion_VSt3bkTnNexl9Pgvg564sM) bash of Gillibrand:

> "While Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand attempt to dodge questions from their own constituents, they're quietly preparing to rubberstamp a flawed health care bill that will hurt New York families, seniors, and small businesses. Unfortunately for voters in the Empire State, this legislation will raise taxes, cut critical Medicare funding, and increase health care premiums for families struggling to make ends meet. Next November, the people of New York will finally have an opportunity to send a clear message to the Democrats who are running Congress and restore the checks-and-balances that they deserve in Washington."

Well, first Republicans need some opposing candidates, who don't yet exist.

While it's true that Schumer has been uncharacteristically quiet on health care and Gillibrand even more so, it should be noted Schumer did get on the phone yesterday, and both sent statements.

They are both after the jump, in full.**Statement of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Health Care Reform:**

The Senate health care bill is good for New York. It would provide health insurance to 2.7 million residents who do not currently have it and provide approximately 734,000 residents who have non-group insurance with affordable coverage through the health insurance exchange - a historic achievement. It would also provide 1.6 million New York residents and 249,000 small businesses with premium tax credits to help them purchase health coverage. Plus, more than a half a million New York seniors who are currently being denied prescription drug coverage because they fall into the Medicare Part D "doughnut hole," will now get coverage for their medicine.

And for New Yorkers and all Americans, this bill ends unscrupulous insurance practices. No longer will people be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions and no longer will one illness force families into bankruptcy. And, now, all preventative care must be covered by all insurers at no or low cost. This will save billions for New York because it moves us to a preventive care system and away from an emergency-based system.

There are a number of additional things that I have been working on as part of health care reform that will specifically help New York, including the Medicare Advantage fix, which helps 800,000 seniors. Plans across Upstate New York would receive bonus payments starting in 2014 when the rate changes go into effect. Since New York City has one of the largest populations on Medicare, plans would receive additional funding in the form of transitional rebates through 2019.

I also worked with Senator Schumer to ensure that the Senate bill does not cut teaching hospitals - a fix that saves New York an estimated $30 billion.

The Senate health care bill makes great strides, but is certainly not all that I hoped for. I am troubled by the Nelson compromise, the elimination of the public plan, and certain ways that the Medicaid formula will affect New York.

I fought hard to defeat the harmful Stupak language, which would have put the lives of women and girls at grave risk and deny them their constitutional rights.

There are aspects of the House bill that that would provide New York with more funding for Medicaid, and I am working closely with Majority Leader Reid, Senator Schumer, other Senators, and members of New York's Congressional delegation to adopt some of the House measures during conference.

**Statement of --Sen. Charles Schumer:**

"Our first priority with this bill was protecting people and jobs in New York, not the state government.

"We got a special protection worth billions of dollars to stop Medicare cuts for 800,000 New York seniors. New York is one of just three states to receive such a protection.

"We prevented an assault on $30 billion that goes to New York hospitals to train physicians. This is one of the most important and most vulnerable sources of funding to New York, and it supports tens of thousands of jobs.

"There are no cuts in this bill to the state government's very generous Medicaid program, but in these tough times, New York does deserve some extra help for its generosity. We will fight as hard as we can when the House and Senate bills are merged to achieve this end."
