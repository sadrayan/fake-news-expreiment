L'oreal abusing monkey during animal testing
Dan Crespo Yes, I did read the article... Loreal's website states: "L’Oréal no longer tests on animals any of its products or any of its ingredients, anywhere in the world. Nor does L’Oréal delegate this task to others. An exception could only be made if regulatory authorities demanded it for safety or regulatory purposes." If you allow for exceptions, like the case with China, then how can you in good conscious state : "L’Oréal no longer tests on animals any of its products or any of its ingredients, anywhere in the world" Either you do, or you don't... Unless of course you label all your products with "We dont test on animals unless they are Chinese". As for the monkey in the video, I hope your right about China not testing on Primates...im left with hoping, because if I consider Chinas policy on Animal rights in general, I would be left with a creeping suspicion that if this were happening, China would be the most logical place to look for it.﻿
