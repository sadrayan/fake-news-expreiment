Nationscredit Closes Last 100 Offices Across U.s. Company Was Accused Of Predatory Lending, Making Expensive Loans To The Poor.

The organization, often called a predatory lender by consumer groups, ran an office in Allentown for 63 years before it closed in January 1996, taking 321 jobs out of the area with it.

NationsCredit, a consumer lending branch of Bank of America Corp., shut down its remaining 100 offices for good this summer.

At that time, the local office's functions were divided between Dallas, at that time the headquarters of NationsCredit Corp., and Atlanta.

The financial services company announced its intention to leave Allentown in the same month the Bon-Ton Stores Inc. closed its flagship store at Ninth and Hamilton streets.

"After the pain they inflicted on this community when they left town, I'm glad they closed. There's a certain amount of prison justice in that," said Alan Jennings, executive director of Community Action Committee of Lehigh Valley.

Nationally, there's a campaign against companies that prey on people with credit problems, he said.

While there is some role for sub-prime lenders -- companies that charge more than the going rate to lend money to customers with less-than-perfect credit ratings -- most have become predators, Jennings said.

NationsCredit, in particular, developed a reputation for predatory lending, he said.

"I'm sure there are many communities celebrating that it's closed, especially Charlotte, its headquarters," Jennings said.

Southern activists agreed.

"It brings joy to my heart to see NationsCredit close," said Peter Skillern, executive director of the Community Reinvestment Association of North Carolina in Charlotte.

With his help and testimony before Congress, his state was the first to pass an anti-predatory lending law.

"NationsCredit was built on a practice that stripped people of their wealth," Skillern said.

People were at high risk of being taken advantage of just for walking into a NationsCredit office, he said.

Customers of either Bank of America, which owns NationsCredit's parent, NationsBank, or NationsBank itself pay much lower interest rates on loans and are not hammered with outrageous prepayment fees, such as the ones NationsCredit inflicts, Skillern said.

Getting money from NationsBank or walking a few doors down the street to get it from NationsCredit -- essentially the same company -- is the difference between night and day.

"It's separate and unequal credit, and there's no regulatory recourse,` Skillern said.

Ongoing loans from NationsCredit will be handled by another subsidiary of Bank of America, EquiCredit, said Jerri Franz, a Bank of America spokeswoman. That company has no brick-and-mortar outlets, and only services loans it buys, thus lowering its ability to so broadly take advantage of people, Skillern said.

The decision to close the 100 NationsCredit operations June 1 was based on "what's necessary to grow profits for Bank of America," she said.

No consideration was given to the ethical concerns of predatory lending, she said.

At the end of June, First Union Bank, also based in Charlotte, closed its sub-prime division, The Money Store, which had one branch in the Lehigh Valley.
