If you have a big name business already, chances are your customers have done the work that has allowed you to get to the top of the rankings, but for those small businesses out there it can be a struggle. For you to gain brand recognition, you must use search engine optimization to your advantage.

When a consumer goes to the search engine and types in a keyword looking for information, you want your website to appear on page one of Google. Of course they have to be looking for something that pertains to your site, and in that case, you need to be ranked high enough to have the consumer see the link to your website.

Now you may be confused as to what needs to be done to optimize your website. The first thing you need to figure out is what are the main keywords consumers are typing in to find products and services that you sell. You need to keep track of these keywords and sprinkle them throughout your website, so the search engines pick them up.

Since the major search engines are always changing their algorithms, it can be confusing for a website owner or marketer to keep up with all the changes. But one thing is for sure, marketing online works very well when you combine it with all the latest trends such as what’s going on in social media.

One form of search engine optimization proving extremely popular today is video marketing. Get your brand in a short advertisement before a favorite video drives a lot of traffic to your website. This is useful traffic since it is highly relevant to the latest trends, and search engines see that as a positive. Also, you need to be creative and use social media to your advantage. Create videos of your own and share them on social media. If you are a company needing video marketing done, contact Portland SEO Experts video

A successful business today understands this power, but they don’t just sit back and do what worked well in the past. To succeed today, you have to go out and be aggressive courting as many followers as you can. You do this not by being aggressive towards people, but by showing them fun, unique and creative ideas that either come from videos or information our website provides.

Highly relevant unique content that changes daily is a search engine optimization winner. People love to search for information all day long, and if your website has the latest news that is unique and cannot be found anywhere else, your site will start to gain a following. Slowly but surely this is an excellent way to move up the rankings.

Patience is critical when marketing online because you can be everywhere at once. You have to methodically pick and choose where to market your brand, then let others pick up on it, and hopefully, if all goes well, they will refer people over to your website through links.

Being ranked #1 in search can do so much for your business, but because the online marketing world is a fast moving entity you need to keep up with the times. Do that, and you will succeed.
