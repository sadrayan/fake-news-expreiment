Differences in House & Senate Tax Reform Bills Heading into Conference
After the Senate’s vote on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the early hours of Saturday morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters that while he was not predicting that the conference committee with the House would be “a piece of cake,” he was confident that the chambers could reconcile their differences. He cited efforts to “pre-conference” the bill by adopting key House priorities. For instance: “We’ve moved our initial thinking on this in the direction of the House bill, for example the property tax deduction, in order to get the bills closer together than they were.”

That will be important. When the chambers pass different versions of a bill, conferees are appointed by both the House and the Senate to produce a “conference report” that is satisfactory to the majority of conferees from each chamber. (More on this later, after the table.) The closer the two sides are going into conference, the easier the resulting process.

The good news for proponents of the bill is that McConnell is right: the Senate bill moved in the House’s direction on several important issues, and was already identical on key points. Both move to chained CPI. Both retain the state and local tax property tax deduction, capped at $10,000. After a floor amendment adopted last night in the Senate, both expand 529 college savings accounts to apply to some primary and secondary education expenses. Both feature a 20 percent corporate rate. That does not mean, however, that the two versions are identical.

Here are several important ways in which they differ, all of which would have to be resolved in conference committee. Some are modest, while others, like the fate of the alternative minimum tax and the chambers’ competing approaches to the taxation of pass-through business income, are likely to keep conferees busy. This list, while not exhaustive, covers the major differences between the versions that passed each chamber.

Provision House Version Senate Version Individual Income Tax Rates and Brackets Consolidates current seven income tax rates into four, while retaining the top marginal rate of 39.6 percent and including an income recapture provision which phases out the effect of the 12 percent bracket for high earners, sometimes called a “bubble rate” Single Filer Rate Schedule 12% > $0 25% > $45,000 35% > $200,000 39.6% > $500,000 Retains seven brackets while reducing rates, bringing the top marginal rate to 38.5 percent and avoiding a bubble rate; individual income tax rate changes sunset at the end of 2025 Single Filer Rate Schedule 10% > $0 12% > $9,525 22% > $38,700 24% > $70,000 32% > $160,000 35% > $200,000 38.5% > $500,000

Unless the House simply accedes to the language that passed the Senate, a conference committee must produce a report which addresses all these differences. The conference report must then be approved by both chambers. Such reports are privileged, meaning that the motion to proceed to consideration of the report is not debatable, and that the report must be considered as-is, without amendments. In the case of reconciliation bills, moreover, there is no filibuster, and debate is limited to ten hours. These rules are all very important to the prospects of a bill that passed the Senate with such a narrow margin. But as that margin shows, there may be scant room to negotiate.

Earlier this morning, McConnell referred to the rounds of negotiations necessary to secure 51 votes as a “Rubik’s cube” of coalition-building. Since Senate leadership can afford to lose one vote at most—and perhaps none should Doug Jones, a Democrat, win the December 12th special election in Alabama and thus turn over that seat before the conference report is voted upon—just about any change could be precarious.

McConnell’s belief that these challenges can be surmounted seems reasonable in light of those both chambers have already overcome, but as with all of the negotiations to date, solving this last Rubik’s Cube will prove a delicate operation.
