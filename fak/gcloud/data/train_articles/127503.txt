Larry the Downing Street cat under pressure after rat filmed scurrying past No 10
Damning footage of a rat brazenly scurrying past No 10's famous black door has heaped further pressure on Larry the Downing Street cat.

Larry’s commitment to the job of chief mouser has already been brought into question while statistics published earlier this year suggested Palmerston, the Foreign Office’s cat, was the most lethal feline in Westminster.

The latest video, posted on Twitter by Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s Political Editor, is likely to lead to more questions about Larry's performance and killer instinct.
