Subject: PolitiFact Texas, fact-check inquiry

Hello from the Austin American-Statesman and the fact-checking PolitiFact Texas project. I write seeking Councilman Greg Casar's factual backup for his recent quoted statement that Austin has repeatedly been ranked among, or as the most, economically segregated cities in the U.S.

We saw that comment here:

I'd appreciate hearing back today. As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

Thanks.

Below are three different studies on Austin’s economic segregation:

The Martin Prosperity Institute study ranked Austin as the most economically segregated large metro area in his study “Segregated City” (pages 54 & 56) http://martinprosperity.org/media/Segregated%20City.pdf. You can contact Richard Florida, who was behind the study, at florida@creativeclass.com.

The Urban Institute also ranked Austin as consistently one of the most economically segregated communities in America. You can find that study here: https://www.urban.org/research/publication/cost-segregation (page 12). The people at the Urban Institute who can answer questions on that study are: Mark Treskon MTreskon@urban.org; Daniel Fowler DFowler@urban.org.

In another study, the Urban Institute did a deep dive on Austin and ranked Austin as highly segregated, both in terms of income and race. That information is here: https://apps.urban.org/features/inclusion/index.html?city=austin_TX. To answer questions on that study, you can reach out to Christina Stacy CStacy@urban.org.

KUT recently covered the Urban Institute’s research here: http://kut.org/post/researchers-say-austins-housing-segregation-hurts-entire-community.

Council Member Casar believes that the above studies are compelling and well-researched. We acknowledge that other studies have found the Austin area to be less segregated than the above studies found. Regardless, the Austin area has a serious segregation problem that we should take seriously—especially as the federal government undermines local efforts to integrate our communities.

Thank you,
