The White House
Veterans

Our militaryâ€™s men and women make great sacrifices to protect our country. While serving, they need every asset at their disposal to complete their mission. As veterans, they deserve to be welcomed home by an accountable, responsible Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that puts veterans first. Veterans are also owed world-class health care at the VA or a private provider of their choosing.
