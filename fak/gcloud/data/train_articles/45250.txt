Anti-Gun "Universal" Background Check Bill Reintroduced
Anti-gun U.S. Representatives Peter King (R-N.Y.) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), have introduced new "universal" background check legislation in the form of H.R. 1217. This legislation is similar to the failed Obama and Bloomberg-backed legislation from last congress that attempted to create a “universal” background check system that would criminalize the private transfer of a firearm between life-long friends and even family members.



The NRA opposes this legislation because it does not address the real problems of fixing the broken mental health system and prosecuting criminals. Further, criminals will never submit to such a system so it will never truly be “universal” – and according to a recent Justice Department research paper the only way to enforce “universal background checks” is to create a national registry of gun owners.



Please contact your U.S. Representative and urge him or her to OPPOSE H.R. 1217.
