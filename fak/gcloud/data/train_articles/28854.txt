Benelli
MR1 is the semi-automatic rifle that better symbolizes all that Benelli energy, versatily and reability. It aims to provide a weapon combining the benefits of military models with those of civilian guns. The gas system, the safe hardwearing locking system, and the use of high quality materials constructed in compliance with the strictest industrial parameters, mean that MR1 can guarantee high performance in a .223-caliber Remington. Derived from the Benelli M4 12-caliber semi-automatic designed to guarantee exceptional operation and 100% reliability in all situations and conditions. A rifling pitch of 9" has been chosen from this new Benelli, meaning that the weapon can make best use of the performance of all bullet types. Easily handled, 100% reliable, hard-wearing, durable, safe, versatile, easy to use and precision shooting: these were the objectives underpinning the MR1 design.
