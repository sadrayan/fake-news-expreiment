how much do premium rate services cost and

where does the money go?

Premium rate services currently vary in cost from 10 pence per call/text to £1.50 per minute/text. These charges apply when calling services from a BT landline.

Remember that calling services from, for example, mobile phones, cable networks or public payphones will generally cost more than the advertised rate.

You can check the cost of calling or texting premium rate services from your phone with your own telephone company.

Many services on mobile phones (for example, football goal alert text messages or ringtone downloads) will be charged at a fixed rate per call/text (for example, 50 pence per text message or £1.00 per download).
