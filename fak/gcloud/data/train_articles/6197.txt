Campaign Finance Information System
The Government Accountability Board's Campaign Finance Information System is an online database of all state candidates, committees and contributors, as well as their campaign spending, donations and transfers. CFIS contains campaign finance data from January 2009 to the present . Please click on the CFIS logo or visit cfis.wi.gov.

From July 2002 to July 2008, many committees filed campaign finance reports in electronic spreadsheets. For an index of those electronic filings, click here. To request any of the files listed, email gabcfis@wi.gov. If the information you are seeking is not there, the committee most likely filed on paper. Depending on their age, those reports are located either at the Board offices in Madison, or the State Historical Society.
