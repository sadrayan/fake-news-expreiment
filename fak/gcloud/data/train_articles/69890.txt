There are two different sets of statistics on arms exports published by the Government of Canada. The two sets of statistics are collected from different databases, are used for different purposes, and are not compatible.The Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD) compiles and releases an annual “ Report on the Export of Military Goods from Canada ,” which provides statistics on the export of goods and technology identified on the “Munitions List” section of Canada’s Export Control List (ECL). Items on the “Munitions List” are used mostly by military and police forces for reasons of defence and security.The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and Statistics Canada collect information on ALL items exported from Canada, and classify these items using categories negotiated by the World Customs Organization (WCO). The WCO chapter on “Arms and Ammunition” includes some items that appear on the “Munitions List.” However, it also includes items not on the “Munitions List” (for example, paintballs, ammunition used to frighten birds at airports, flare guns, and certain equipment for oil and gas exploration). CBSA and Statistics Canada information is made available on Industry Canada’s website as “Trade Data Online” and on Statistics Canada’s website as the “Canadian International Merchandise Trade Database.”For further details, please refer to Notes on Trade of Arms and Ammunition
