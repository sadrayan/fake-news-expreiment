Email, Logan Spence, campaign manager, Dan Patrick campaign, April 17, 2014

4:56 p.m.

I can give you a statement:

"All of Dan Patrick's debts associated with the bankruptcy of his restaurants thirty years ago have been settled. What demands explanation is why David Dewhurst refused to repay a personal debt until he was forced by the courts and why he refuses to pay the campaign staff of his failed US Senate campaign in 2012," said campaign manager Logan Spence.
