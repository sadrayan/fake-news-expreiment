President Donald Trump must order FBI Director Jim Comey to open an investigation on the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich
Former DNC staffer Seth Rich was murdered outside of his DC home not long after WikiLeaks began to release the emails of the Democratic National Committee. In the verified emails released by WikiLeaks, there was talk about "making an example" of a suspected whistleblower inside of the DNC. After the death of Seth Rich, WikiLeaks has offered a $25,000 bounty for information on the murderer of Seth Rich. A separate organization recently upped the bounty to $130,000 which was relayed by WikiLeaks. There is more to the story that Seth Rich was only the victim of a robbery. Seth's belongings were not taken from his person, but DC Police swept the story under the rug as a robbery. This investigation needs to be reopened by the honorable FBI until justice is brought. His killer is not yet found.
