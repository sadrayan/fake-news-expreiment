From Monday, June 4, 2018, through Friday, August 3, 2018, the Committee on House Administration and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration invited congressional interns to attend the Congressional Summer Intern Lecture Series. The Lecture Series brings prominent professionals and influencers in their respective fields to speak to summer interns about a variety of topics, from policy discussions to advice about pursuing a successful career in Washington, D.C. and around the world. Each lecture lasts approximately one hour and is considered off-the-record. Only congressional interns are allowed entry .

Each week's schedule will be posted here by the Friday prior.

*All lectures are subject to schedule changes and are considered off-the-record.

All seating for a lecture is on a first come, first serve basis. You will not be able to reserve a seat or spot in line for another intern. Interns are not permitted to arrive at a lectureâ€™s location more than one hour prior to the start time of a lecture. Any intern who arrives earlier than one hour before will be asked to return to his or her office. Once the lecture begins and the doors close, no interns will be granted access to a lecture.
