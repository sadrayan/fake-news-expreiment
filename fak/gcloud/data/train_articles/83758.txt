Statements Require an Apology : MOAA
Donald Trump’s latest disparaging comments about Sen. John McCain abandoning the troops require an apology, according to retired Navy Vice Adm. Norb Ryan, president and CEO of MOAA.

Trump wrote an opinion column, “Trump: I don’t need to be lectured,” in Sunday’s USA Today where he stated, “McCain has abandoned our veterans.”

Ryan issued the following response to Trump’s column.

“Senator McCain will not say it, but let me state the obvious: John McCain is a military hero, and most importantly, he has always been a champion for the all-volunteer-force and our nation’s veterans. John McCain has proven his sincerity and passion for the troops. Leadership is about setting an example and not words. No one has visited our troops in Afghanistan or Iraq more than John McCain. We can disagree with some of Senator McCain’s positions at times, but we can never say he has abandoned the troops. Most recently, as the new chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain demanded that the full Senate debate and vote on the National Defense Authorization Act for the first time in three years. We should acknowledge the facts: John McCain cares deeply about our men and women in uniform, and through his actions, he has made a real difference for our troops. Mr. Trump owes Senator McCain and all veterans an apology."
