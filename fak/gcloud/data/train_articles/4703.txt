Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau

Current law provides a number of penalty enhancement provisions to allow for

increased penalties whenever crimes are committed under specified circumstances.

This bill provides penalty enhancement for violent crimes committed on or within

1,000 feet of school premises or a school bus. If the underlying crime is a felony, the

maximum period of imprisonment is increased by 5 years. If the underlying crime

is a misdemeanor, the maximum period of imprisonment is increased by 6 months.

In addition, unless the person poses a public safety risk, the court may require the

person to complete 100 hours of community service work. A child may be adjudged

delinquent on the basis of these violent crimes committed in school zones and the

court could similarly require the child to perform 100 hours of community service

work. This disposition could be in addition to other delinquency adjudications,

including placement in a secured correctional facility.

The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do

enact as follows:
