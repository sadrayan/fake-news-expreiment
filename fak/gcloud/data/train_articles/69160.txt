Bodies In Cabin Fire Identified As Marshals Assigned To Protect Drug-Smuggling Pelosi Girls
The US Marshals deputies assigned to protect Jillian and Veronica Pelosi until they could testify against the Clintons in front of a grand jury this week have been found shot in the head and burned in a log cabin fire near the Finger Lakes in upstate New York. The Marshals, their weapons and their vehicle were all accounted for but the Pelosis are nowhere to be found.

A nationwide BOLO has been issued for the girls. Federal investigators say the fact that they weren’t simply executed is a good sign that there may be another agenda at play here. Do the Clintons really want more high-profile murders on their hands? They already have to add these two men who were doing nothing other than following orders.

Nancy Pelosi still hasn’t made an attempt to discredit the story as she has apparently given up. Her attorney says she will spend the remainder of her days as a free woman at her home with her four real children enjoying what’s left of her time with family. Pelosi is expected to see more than 20 years in prison, which is, in essence, a death sentence for the 76-year-old.

Authorities are on the lookout for clues and tips and as always, we will keep you updated on this fluid situation.
