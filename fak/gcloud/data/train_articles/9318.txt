DCCC on Obamacare offense: paid web ads for
@MarcACaputo

If Democrats are running away from Obamacare, they have a strange way of showing it.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee today said they're touting Obamacare in this paid web ad targeting Republican Carlos Curbelo, who's running against incumbent Rep. Joe Garcia. The ads should pop up on the computer screens of those who surf the web in District 26.

The gist of the ad: Curbelo is like all other Republicans and supports repealing Obamacare. But it's not clear if Curbelo really does (we're waiting comment). So the ad could be inaccurate. At the least, though, it seeks to smoke out Curbelo's position.

Curbelo, in an email, suggested the ad is misleading because he doesn't want full repeal: "I support substituting Obamacare with legislation that genuinely makes healthcare affordable for all - including those with pre-existing conditions - and that does not punish low income earners and those that employ them"

Anyway, here's the DCCC press release:

“For every statistic, there are millions of seniors who are saving thousands on prescription drugs, countless Americans who won't face bankruptcy because of health care, and millions of sick kids who are guaranteed coverage – and those are the people who Candidate Curbelo is hurting with his obsessive repeal efforts,” said Emily Bittner of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Not only would Candidate Curbelo’s repeal hurt millions of middle class Americans, his leaders refuse to put forward an agenda to solve these problems. The costs of Candidate Curbelo’s repeal are simply too high – and these are the faces of those who will hurt the most.”

And the web ad:
