Hello!

While Leroy has since deleted the photo, you can see in the conversation here he admits to taking and posting the photo and references the Snopes article about it.

The Brown Berets staged this protest- I'm sure you reviewed the photos already:

Here's my own tweet on the topic:

I think we all appreciate the seriousness and want to draw attention to the inhumanity of the immigration policy, but we have to think about how we're using images like these and the ways in which they might distract from the issue at hand.

That being said, Jose Vargas, whom I have a great deal of respect and admiration for, is simply trying to draw attention to the facts surrounding how families and children are treated at the southern border. It's a shame that this protest image has become the focus of conversation and not the policy itself.

Please feel free to quote me in any capacity that you find useful.

Thanks for reaching out!

Thanks again.

I hope we hear from Pena. In the FB post you just shared, I am not seeing a statement from him saying that he took the photo.

Yes- that’s the text of the tweet as I posted it in response to Jose.

While he doesn’t say it outright, Leroy certainly alludes to it. I hope he’s willing to make a statement.

Here you go, Selby.

I found it using the internet archive.

I also attached a screenshot. When it comes to the internet, nothing is ever truly lost.

Cheers,

I just used that old link from the deleted tweet of mine you dug up and took it the internet archive.

Go to this site:

It just happened to have been up long enough for it to take one snapshot of the link. When you put this url into the search box it returns the original post. I dunno if you can see the comments but the post is there.
