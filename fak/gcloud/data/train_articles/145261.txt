Illinois Distracted Driving Laws
In efforts to reduce the number of car accidents that are caused by distracted drivers, the state of Illinois is continuously improving and strengthening its distracted driving laws. Accidents related to distracted driving often result in serious injury, and even death, which is why state legislators feel that putting strict distracted driving laws into effect is necessary. In Illinois, there is a ban on hand-held cell phone use for certain categories of drivers, as well as a texting ban for all drivers.

Hand-held Ban

All drivers in the state of Illinois are banned from using hand-held cell phones while driving in a highway construction zone, as well as while driving through a school zone. However, they are allowed to use cell phones in these zones if they have some type of hands-free technology.

Text Messaging Ban

In Illinois, all drivers are banned from texting while behind the wheel. This is a ban that exists in almost all states, as texting while driving is particularly dangerous. This is a primary law, and the minimum fine for everyone who breaks it is set at $75.

Novice Drivers

Drivers in Illinois that are younger than 19 are considered to be novice drivers, and they are banned from using both hand-held and hands-free cell phones while behind the wheel. This is also a primary law.

Bus Drivers

Just like novice drivers, there is a primary law for bus drivers, too, who are not allowed to use hand-held and hands-free cell phones while driving.
