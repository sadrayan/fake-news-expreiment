Two-Thirds of the 737 Max 8 Jets in the World Have Been Pulled From the Skies
Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, the two carriers in the United States that use the 737 Max 8, also said they remained confident in the safety of the planes and planned to continue flying them. Both airlines have said they have analyzed data from their thousands of flights with the jets and found no reason to ground them.

The Canadian transport minister, Marc Garneau, has indicated that Canada will not ground the plane until American regulators have determined the cause of the latest crash. But he also opened the possibility for a change in thinking.

“I’ve canceled all my meetings and public events today in order to meet with my Civil Aviation Expert Panel,” he said on Twitter. “All evidence is being evaluated in real time and we’re considering all potential actions.”

One overarching concern among regulators around the world is whether the system suspected of playing a role in the Lion Air crash had contributed to the latest accident.

Indonesian and American authorities have raised the possibility that a new system in the 737 Max — and pilots’ lack of familiarity with it — could have contributed to the Lion Air Flight 610 crash. The plane’s so-called maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, known as MCAS, was a new version that could automatically change the aircraft’s trajectory.

The similarities, with both planes crashing minutes after erratic takeoffs, are driving authorities to order the groundings. Despite Boeing and American authorities standing behind the plane, regulators and carriers elsewhere are opting to ban the plane in the absence of clear information.
