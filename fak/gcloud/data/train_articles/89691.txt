Voters Still See Voter Fraud As A Problem

The Supreme Court this week upheld Ohio’s aggressive efforts to purge voter rolls of people who haven’t cast ballots in a while, much to the dismay of liberal voters’ rights groups. But few voters have ever been illegally denied the right to vote, and they think it happens less often than illegally allowing people to vote.

A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 44% of Likely U.S. Voters think it’s more common that people are allowed to vote who are not eligible to vote. Just 36% think, more often, people are prevented from voting who should be allowed to vote. Twenty percent (20%) are not sure which happens more often. (To see survey question wording, click here.)
