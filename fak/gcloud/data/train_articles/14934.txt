BREAKING: Hillary Clinton Killed Filming A Documentary In Missouri
Hillary Clinton was killed this afternoon when she attempted to “do her own stunt” while shooting a documentary about the 2016 election. Clinton, who is known to be sickly and feeble, tried to re-create her fall outside the 9/11 Memorial.

That was when things went bad, according to filmmaker Art Tubolls:

“She went to fall and twist on the sidewalk like she did in new York, only we’re in downtown St. Louis filming on a budget. the drop is 11 inches, not 4. She flipped over sideways and opened her skull on the Missouri granite that lines the roadways. Looked like cottage cheese with strawberry sauce.”

Clinton was supposed to have been caught by two Secret Service agents, but since the filming wasn’t official business, the studio used actors. “They were unprepared for the fall,” said the agents on the scene who watched helplessly as their assignment’s brains became one with the St. Louis sewer system, “they had no reflexes; no natural ability to make adjustments. Mrs. Clinton was killed by incompetence.”

The family has been notified and Clinton’s body has been sent home to New York where it can be buried with her and Bill’s victims on their quiet Chappaqua compound.
