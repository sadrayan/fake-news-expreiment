Gulfstream III N103CD comes off runway at Biggin Hill

A 1984-build Gulfstream III private jet (msn 418 / N103CD) ran-off the runway at London Biggin Hill Airport, following an aborted take-off attempt.

The aircraft was attempting to depart from Biggin Hill during the evening of 24 November to Gander Airport in Canada when the accident occurred.

Eight people were on board the aircraft at the time of the incident. One was taken to a local hospital to receive treatment for minor injuries.

“A private plane has been involved in an accident on take off from Biggin Hill. We’re working with airport fire crews to contain a fuel spill,” said a fire brigade spokesperson.

Reports suggest that a wheel may have come off the aircraft during its take-off run.

With the aircraft stuck in the mud, Biggin Hill Airport remained closed overnight.

Gulfstream III N103CD had arrived at Biggin Hill from Gander Airport during the morning of November 21.

FAA records show that the aircraft is registered to World Heir Inc, at an address in Georgia in the US.
