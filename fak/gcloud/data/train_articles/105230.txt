BREAKING: Google Exec Admits They Rig Search Results Against Trump
Well, well, well. On Tuesday morning, President Trump tweeted that Google rigs search results to show only fake news articles from the mainstream media intended to hurt him.

“Google search results for ‘Trump News’ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media,” the president said Tuesday on Twitter

“In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out,” he added. “Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives.”

Initially, Google denied the completely reasonable accusation. But then CFO Martin Brailey let it slip that Google manipulates its algorithms.

“Most results show organically, but if something is extremely offensive, we do remove it or place it lower in results manually,” Brailey said in an interview with CNN . “Much of what the President says, frankly, is offensive. If someone defends it, it is offensive.”

“So what we do is place it on page 2 or 5.” he added . “That way people can still access it, but we can ensure that people find information that is not only accurate but less offensive.”

So this is what happens? Google decides something is “offensive” and censors conservative voices — even the President’s — on a whim?

It’s time to stop using Google and turn to other search engines like Yahoo and AOL, both of whom have provided assurances that they don’t manipulate their results.

Trump suggested that what Google is doing is “illegal.” He’s also right — it is illegal. It is a violation of U.S.C. 991 Sec 21.a.
