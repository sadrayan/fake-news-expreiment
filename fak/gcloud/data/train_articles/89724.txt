The amount of your fine will depend on the model of your vehicle beginning in 2018 If you are caught speeding, the amount of your fine will depend on the model of your vehicle. The more expensive the vehicle, the more expensive the fine will be. The photographs taken by radars will be able to determine the model of the car, motorcycle, or truck. The cheapest vehicles will be fined lightly, whereas high-end vehicles will face much heavier fines. This measure acknowledges the inequality between those “who can afford” to pay the fines and those who “suffer” under the repressive system. Thus, the wallets of the most well-to-do will be hit just as hard as those of the most humble. The measure promises to reduce delinquency on the road by the wealthy, thus eliminating the feeling of impunity shared among more and more drivers.
