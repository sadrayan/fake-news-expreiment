McCain 180 on Off-shore Drilling
MCCAIN CAVES TO BIG OIL ON OFF-SHORE DRILLING

1999: McCain, Campaigning In California, Endorsed A Moratorium On Offshore Oil Drilling. "For a moment, Republican presidential hopeful John McCain almost sounded like a San Francisco liberal. The Arizona senator said yesterday that gays and lesbians would be welcome to serve in his administration. He decried the influence of money in politics. He endorsed a moratorium on offshore oil drilling." [San Francisco Chronicle, 7/29/99]

1999: McCain Supports The Current Moratorium On Oil Drilling. "In response to a query of the candidates, Gore and Bradley promised to support the existing moratorium, in addition to opposing the leases. Both also say they will work with the seven oil companies holding leases to find alternatives to drilling. That could mean canceling the leases, or buying out the companies in a deal like the one that secured the Headwaters Forest. McCain supports the current moratorium, but hasn't decided on the pending leases. Steve Forbes hasn't replied to questions about oil drilling." [Ventura County Star, 11/15/99]

McCain Said He Supported Florida's Decision Not To Drill For Oil. While meeting with Gov. Charlie Crist, McCain trumpeted his support of Florida's position on oil drilling, saying "In the case of the Everglades, the people of Florida have decided they don't want that tampered with for a variety of reasons and I totally agree." [AP, 10/2/2007]

McCain Said The Decision To Drill Should Be Left Up To The States. At a campaign event in Michigan, McCain promised voters he would not drill in ANWR, arguing that it should be a states decision. McCain said, "That's a fundamental federalist principle that I have. The states should decide what to do with their assets… if the states and others want to have drilling off their coast, such as Louisiana does, then that's fine with me. We're doing a great deal off Louisiana. The people of California don't want to and, as a federalist, I will respect that, as well." [McCain Campaign Event, Ypsilanti, Michigan, 1/15/08]

But, McCain Voted Against An Amendment To Give Coastal States More Authority In Federal Off-Shore Drilling Decisions. In 1992, McCain voted to kill an amendment to the National Energy Policy bill (S 2166) which would have strengthened the role of coastal states in federal offshore drilling decisions.

MCCAIN'S OPPOSITION TO RENEWABLES

McCain's "Mixed Record" On The Environment Includes Votes Against Tougher Fuel Efficiency Standards And Incentives For Renewable Energy. "In speeches on the campaign trail, Mr. McCain frequently highlights the threat of climate change, but he has a mixed record on the environment in the Senate. In recent years he has pushed legislation to curb emissions that contribute to climate change, but he has missed votes on toughening fuel economy standards and has opposed tax breaks meant to encourage alternative energy… Leaders of several environmental groups were also sharply critical and noted Mr. McCain's Senate votes against incentives for energy conservation and alternative energy sources like wind and solar power." [New York Times, 5/13/2008]

MCCAIN TALKS BOOSTING RENEWABLES,

HE JUST WON'T PAY FOR THEM.

President Of The League Of Conservation Voters Said McCain Should Stop Subsidizing "Mature" Industry Of Nuclear Power, Start Investing In Renewable Energy. According to a statement from Gene Karpinkski, president of the League "[It] is troubling that he continues to support taxpayer subsidies for a mature industry like nuclear which has yet to resolve its waste disposal problem…It would be far more cost-effective to invest in renewable energy like the wind energy plant he is visiting today. Better still would be a call for a renewable electricity standard, something he has voted against time and time again." [The Nation, 5/12/2008]

McCain Says He Would Veto The Farm Bill -- $300 Million in Renewable Biofuels Funding. The farm bill "provides $300 million in mandatory funding for payments to support production of advanced biofuels including cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel." There is also "$250 million in grants and loan guarantees for renewable energy and energy efficiency systems for agriculture and rural small businesses." [McCain Prepared Remarks, 5/19/08; Reuters, 5/15/2008]
