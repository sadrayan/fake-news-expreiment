Cancer

Dr Wollaston: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many prosecutions have taken place under the Cancer Act 1939 in each of the last 30 years. [198623]

Jeremy Wright: The number of defendants proceeded against at magistrates courts for offences under the Cancer Act 1939, in England and Wales, from 1984 to 2013, can be viewed in the table.

Defendants proceeded against at magistrates courts for offences under section 4 of the Cancer Act 1939, England and Wales, 1984 to 20131, 2 Number 1984 - 1985 1 1986 - 1987 - 1988 - 1989 - 1990 - 1991 - 1992 - 1993 - 1994 - 1995 2 1996 -

Driving Under Influence

Paul Flynn: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice (1) how many fines have been (a) paid, (b) collected and (c) reduced for alcohol-related motoring offences in each of the last four years; [199838]

(2) how many fines have been (a) paid, (b) collected and (c) reduced for motoring speeding offences in each of the last four years. [199839]

Mr Vara: It is not possible to identify from Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals systems how many fines have been (a) paid, (b) collected and (c) reduced for specific offences. This information could be provided only at disproportionate cost as identifying this would require a manual search of all fine accounts.

Fly Tipping

Gavin Williamson: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice (1) how many people were convicted of fly-tipping in South Staffordshire in each year since 2009-10; and how many such people received the maximum allowable sentence; [199178]

(2) how many of those convicted of fly-tipping were handed the maximum possible sentence in each year since 2009-10; [199179]

(3) how many people were convicted of fly-tipping in (a) 2009-10, (b) 2010-11, (c) 2011-12, (d) 2012-13 and (e) 2013-14. [199238]

Jeremy Wright: The number of offenders found guilty at all courts of “fly tipping” related offences, in England and Wales, from 2009-10 to 2012-13, and also specifically

Judicial Review

Mr Crausby: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment he has made of the potential effect of the new judicial review regulations on people who are fighting eviction or the repossession of a house. [199208]

Mr Vara: Judicial review is an important way of challenging decisions by public authorities and will remain so. The recently amended regulations do not prevent people receiving legal aid in judicial review cases.

The Government's policy is that limited legal aid resources should be targeted at those judicial review cases where they are needed most, if the legal aid system is to command public confidence and credibility. We amended the Civil Legal Aid (Remuneration) Regulations 2013 to implement the proposal that legal aid providers should only be paid for work carried out on an application for permission if permission is given by the court, subject to a discretion to pay providers for work carried out on an application for permission in cases that conclude prior to a permission decision. The discretion is held by the Lord Chancellor but will be exercised by the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) on behalf of the Lord Chancellor. The amendments took effect on 22 April 2014.

An assessment of the impacts of this policy was published alongside the consultation response paper “Judicial Review: Proposals for Further Reform: the Government Response” and is available at

https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/judicial-review

It is important to reiterate that no change has been made to the availability of civil legal aid to individuals or to eligibility for legal aid for judicial review proceedings. Where a client is in receipt of legal aid, he or she will remain so for the life of the case (unless it is withdrawn for other reasons). We consider that there will remain sufficient providers who undertake judicial review work, taking on cases which they consider to be of merit.

The Government plan to undertake a post-implementation review of the legal aid provisions within the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 within 3-5 years of implementation. The review will include an assessment of the impact of this change.

Legal Aid Scheme

Mr Crausby: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if he will make it his policy to release statistics on the number of refusals by the Legal Aid Agency to pay legal aid in cases settled before the permission stage. [199207]

12 Jun 2014 : Column 315W

Mr Vara: The Legal Aid Agency records information on the outcome of each application for a discretionary payment in respect of remuneration for work on applications for permission for judicial review, where a case concludes before a decision on permission is taken by the court. The Government are considering the best way of publishing this information.

Magistrates' Courts: Prestatyn

Chris Ruane: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what his policy is on the redevelopment of Prestatyn Magistrates' Court. [199564]

Mr Vara: HM Courts and Tribunals Service continues to keep the use of its estate under review to ensure it meets operational requirements.

Prison Service

Sadiq Khan: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice (1) on what occasions prisons have used detached duty staff from other establishments since 1 September 2013; [199480]

(2) how many staff of each grade were used as part of the detached duty arrangements in each month since December 2013; [199481]

(3) how many staff of each grade were available for detached duty arrangements in each month since December 2013; [199482]

(4) which prisons received how many detached duty staff of each grade in each month since December 2013; [199483]

(5) how much was spent on accommodation and subsistence for prison officers providing detached duty in prisons in (a) January, (b) February, (c) March and (d) April 2014. [199502]

12 Jun 2014 : Column 316W

Jeremy Wright: The deployment of staff between prisons on detached duty is a regular and normal part of prison resourcing. It allows staff to be allocated from prisons with the capacity to provide them, to those where additional staffing is required. On average over the three month period (January to March 2013), less than 1% of staff were provided on detached duty. A large proportion of the capacity is typically available from prisons that are in the process of closure or going through a re-role. This process temporarily releases a number of officers who are not supplied for specific occasions but are sent and received on a shift pattern throughout the week.

The number of staff available for detached duty at any one time is a matter for operational judgment and takes account of overall staff numbers, levels of sickness, prisoner numbers and the regime and security requirements.

The average weekly provision of staff, broken down by grade, that were received as part of the nationally co-ordinated detached duty scheme , are shown in the tables below for January to March 2014.

Table: Average weekly provision of staff on detached duty to prisons in England and Wales, broken down by grade, January-March 2014 Grade January 2014 February 2014 March 2014 Band 3 200 150 130 Band 4 10 10 - Total 210 160 130

We have maintained our policy of rounding figures to the nearest 10 in line with the department’s policy for presenting staffing data. The data are only accurate to this level because late updating of data within HR systems means that the unrounded figures recorded for a specific date have a margin of error around them. Totals are formed from unrounded parts prior to rounding. For this reason, rounded totals may not equal the sum of their rounded parts. Values of 5 or fewer are denoted as ‘-’.

Using centrally held financial records it is not possible, without incurring disproportionate cost, to disaggregate the costs of accommodation and subsistence claimed for detached duty from other expenses claimed by staff.

Prisoners: Sanitary Protection

Kate Green: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what types and brands of sanitary products female prisoners are able to purchase from the National Product List; and what the cost of each such product is. [199603]

Simon Hughes: Female prisoners can purchase the following sanitary products from the National Product List:

Sanitary pads—Always Ultra Normal 32s—price £2.69

Sanitary towels—Tena Lady Normal 12s—price £2.69

Kate Green: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what types and brands of sanitary products are provided to female prisoners free of charge. [199604]

Simon Hughes: All prisons across the female custodial estate provide Interlude tampons and sanitary towels to women free of charge.

Public Defender Service

Mr Slaughter: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what plans he has for the future of the Public Defender Service. [199628]

Mr Vara: The Public Defender Service (PDS) will continue to deliver a range of quality services within the criminal defence market from advice and representation at the police station and magistrates courts through to advocacy in the higher courts.

Secure Colleges

Dan Jarvis: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the average annual cost is of a place in a new Secure College. [199691]

Jeremy Wright: The Government's vision for Secure Colleges was set out on 17 January 2014 in its response to the consultation paper “Transforming Youth Custody”. Secure Colleges will place education at the heart of custody, and equip young people with the skills they need to turn their lives around.

The current average cost of a place in youth custody is around £100,000 per annum, with some places costing in excess of £200,000. Secure colleges will achieve ongoing savings by operating at a significantly lower cost per place than the current average, while allowing withdrawal from more expensive and inefficient provision.

The MOJ will not publish estimates of the annual cost per place until the operator competition for the Secure College has been completed, to avoid prejudicing the effectiveness of the competition.

Dan Jarvis: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice when the construction contract for a Secure College awarded to Wates was put out to tender. [199694]

12 Jun 2014 : Column 319W

Jeremy Wright: Invitations to tender for the design and build of the Secure College pathfinder were issued under the Ministry of Justice's Strategic Alliance Framework Agreement on 31 January 2014, shortly after we published the Government response to the Transforming Youth Custody consultation on 17 January and announced plans for the Secure College pathfinder in the east midlands.

Dan Jarvis: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what fee Wates will receive for the construction contract for a Secure College; and what proportion of the overall budget for a Secure College this fee will represent. [199695]

Jeremy Wright: The Ministry of Justice will work with Wates to develop a design for the Secure College pathfinder over the coming months, and will agree a maximum price for the construction once the detailed project proposals have been agreed.

Dan Jarvis: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice when the construction contract for a Secure College was formally awarded to Wates. [199696]

Jeremy Wright: The construction contract for the Secure College pathfinder has not been awarded. The Ministry of Justice has selected Wates as the preferred bidder to design and build the pathfinder. The Project Partnering Agreement, which commits the Ministry of Justice to working with Wates to develop the design for the Secure College pathfinder, will be signed later this month. A further contract, a Commencement Agreement, is required for construction.

Victim Support Schemes

Mr Crausby: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what assessment he has made of the effect on funding available for victims' services of devolution to police and crime commissioners. [199326]

Damian Green: From 1 October 2014 the majority of support services for victims of crime will be commissioned at the local level by democratically elected and publicly accountable police and crime commissioners and this Government are making more money than ever before available to ensure that victims receive the vital support they require.

PCCs with their knowledge of local victims’ needs are uniquely placed to ensure that available funding is targeted where most required to help victims of crime to both cope with and, where possible, recover from the impacts of crime.

PCCs are also ideally placed to co-commission with other local commissioners such as health or local authorities, thereby reducing duplication and achieving better value for money.

Victim Support Schemes: York

Hugh Bayley: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many victims of crime and witnesses were supported by the Witness Service at (a) York Crown court and (b) York magistrates court in each year since 2004-05. [198529]

12 Jun 2014 : Column 320W

Damian Green: The Ministry of Justice does not routinely collect these data. Victim Support has provided the data based on available information.

As part of its grant in aid to Victim Support, the Ministry of Justice requires the provision of a court- based witness service.

Victim Support has provided the following figures for 2009-10 to 2013-14 showing the number of people supported:

York Crown court York magistrates court 2009-10 717 606 2010-11 701 405 2011-12 612 368 2012-13 557 333 2013-14 547 870

Whilst crime rates continue to fall, Victim Support continues to support all witnesses who wish to receive support when attending court.

Business, Innovation and Skills

Adult Education

David Simpson: To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills what steps he is taking to educate adults in literacy, numeracy and ICT skills. [199220]

Matthew Hancock: Skills policy is devolved so this answer refers to policy in England only.

One of the Government's priorities is to ensure that all adults have the level of English, maths and digital skills to help them find and sustain employment, as well as achieving other positive outcomes such as improved health and well-being.

We are implementing a major programme of reform to raise the quality and standards of these vital subjects in adult education which will improve the quality of the teaching workforce, reward the best providers and ensure learners are stretched to achieve the best they can.

We are investing £30 million this year and next to attract the best graduates to teach in further education (FE) and to provide opportunities for existing teachers to improve their skills. As part of a £15 million bursary scheme between 2013-15 we are offering up to £20,000 to the best and brightest graduates to teach in FE. In January 2014 we announced further measures to improve the workforce including; a golden-hello scheme offering a bonus of £7,500 to maths graduates in their second year of teaching; a recruitment incentive scheme offering £20,000 to providers for taking on a specialist maths graduate teacher; and a subject knowledge enhancement scheme to enable highly qualified graduates who have the skills and aptitude to teach but need to develop some specific maths skills before they start teacher training.

We have put English and maths at the heart of all our major programmes. From 2014/15 all intermediate apprentices will be required to work towards achieving a level 2 in English and maths and young people undertaking a traineeship will be required to study English and maths unless they already have a level 2 qualification in English and maths.

12 Jun 2014 : Column 321W

We fully fund all adults to achieve their first English and maths GCSE as well as other qualifications which help them get to that level. Our reforms to English and maths GCSEs will make them more rigorous and help ensure that young people and adults develop the skills most relevant to employers. The reformed GCSEs will be available for first teaching from September 2015 and our ambition is for them to become the gold-standard measuring achievement at level 2 for all ages and ability levels.

We encourage and support a wide range of different and flexible types of provision so that adults can learn in a way that suits them, for example, learning in the workplace, Community Learning including Family English, Maths and Language (FEML) provision, through traditional college courses and using technology and online learning.

We are making sure jobseekers on benefits have the best chance of finding employment by helping them improve their literacy and numeracy skills. From April 2014, those with poor spoken English which is preventing them from finding work have been expected to train in English, with the possibility of losing their benefit if they choose not to participate. In December 2014, we will launch the 18-21 Work Skills pilot which will test different approaches to teaching and learning and the outcomes of mandating new 18 to 21-year-old jobseeker’s allowance claimants with English and maths below Level 2 to English and maths training for up to 16 hours per week, alongside their jobsearch.

We have a substantial programme of research to identify the most effective approaches to teaching and learning. In April, I announced the launch of a new research centre with the Behavioural Rights Insight Team to bring the latest findings from behavioural science to bear on the challenges of improving adult literacy and numeracy.

Basic digital skills are now seen to be as vital as literacy and numeracy, not just for employment but for all aspects of life. The Government's recent Digital Inclusion Strategy set what actions we will take to ensure everyone has these skills. The strategy can be found at:

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy

For its part, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has committed over £30 million over the last 5 years to UK online centres to help more people develop the basic digital skills needed to use a computer, and to get online safely and securely. This has so far helped over 1.25 million people, most of whom were adults, get online. A £1 million extension to the current programme will help another 43,000 people to get online. This is aimed at hard to reach groups, many who are socially excluded. We are currently in the process of tendering a new programme with the aim to get another 1 million people online in the next 3-5 years.

Alison Seabeck: To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills what funding was available through the Skills Funding Agency for (a) adult learning courses to support return-to-work programmes and (b) English as a Second Language courses in each of the last three years. [199410]

12 Jun 2014 : Column 322W

Matthew Hancock: The funding available for Adult Skills is outlined in the Skills Funding Statement. The statement sets out the Government's priorities for the budget and it is for providers to decide how they use their adult skills funding to reflect those priorities and meet the needs of learners and employers in their local area. The Skills Funding Statements 2012-15 and 2013-16 also show in the Data Annex what learning the available funding has supported over the last three years:

Animal Experiments

Henry Smith: To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills how many animals have experienced severe suffering in scientific research funded by the Government since 2010; and if he will provide funding aimed at developing scientific advances allowing the reduction or avoidance of severe suffering of animals used in procedures. [198601]

Mr Willetts: The Government do not hold the information you have requested. The Home Office has published advisory notes on recording and reporting actual severity. From data collected, the Home Office will provide clarity on the burden of harm and, over time, should give an indication of the effectiveness of refinement methods, particularly for the most severe procedures.

It is important to note that procedures classified as severe represent only a small percentage of the total.

The National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) was established by the Government in May 2004 to advance and promote the replacement, refinement and reduction of animals used in research and testing (the 3Rs). The NC3Rs primarily receives Government funding through BIS from the science and research ring-fenced budget via the Medical Research Council (MRC) and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). The projected budget for the NC3Rs is £7.88 million in 2014-15 and £7.84 million in 2015-16.

BBSRC also provides further funding for the 3Rs under its responsive mode schemes, and the MRC and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council support research projects which contribute to the development of new knowledge and new methods that help replace or refine animal use. However, figures on future spend are not available.

For a detailed breakdown of past funding I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), on 11 March 2014, Official Report, column 167W.

China

Jim Shannon: To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills what recent discussions he has had with the Chinese Government on the export of British cheeses to China. [198745]

Michael Fallon: The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, the right hon. Member for



12 Jun 2014 : Column 323W

Twickenham (Vince Cable), has not had any recent discussions with the Chinese Government regarding the export of British cheese to China. However, officials at the British embassy in Beijing have been in contact with the relevant authorities regarding the recent temporary suspension of imports of British cheese into China. The suspension has now ended.

Credit Rating

Mr Tom Clarke: To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills what his policy is on a minimum monetary threshold for a late payment which affects an individual's credit rating. [199030]

Matthew Hancock: Credit ratings will take into account a number of different variables, including late payment, but it is a commercial judgment taken by credit reference agencies.

Digital Technology: Skilled Workers

Andrew Bingham: To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (1) what plans he has to address the shortage of skilled workers in the digital and technology sector; [198735]

(2) what progress his Department has made on the Information Economy Strategy published in June 2013. [198736]

Mr Willetts: The Industrial Strategy One Year On Progress Report:

https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/306854/bis-14-707-industrial-strategy-progress-report.pdf

published on 23 April, provides an update on progress on the Information Economy Strategy. The Information Economy Council is driving forward action in several areas including addressing skills issues, barriers to growth, and the analysis and use of data sets.

As a part of our work on skills we have created higher apprenticeships as an alternative to traditional graduate recruitment. In IT higher apprenticeships there have been 420 starts in 2012/13 compared with 60 starts in 2010/11. We have also created cyber security schools programmes, apprenticeships, internships, Centres for Doctoral Training and will shortly be launching a Cyber Security Massive Open Online Course.

Disabled Students' Allowances

Mr Buckland: To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (1) if he will carry out a public consultation on proposed changes to disabled students' allowances; [198941]

(2) with reference to his written statement of 7 April 2014, Official Report, columns 1-2WS, on Higher Education: student support, what impact assessment his Department has made of the proposed changes to disabled students' allowances. [199002]

Mr Willetts: We are currently consulting with a wide range of stakeholders to help inform both the Equality Analysis and Disabled Students' Allowances Guidance for 2015/16.

12 Jun 2014 : Column 324W

I will have due regard to an updated Equality Analysis before a final decision is made and regulations are laid before the House.

Mr Buckland: To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills how many students of each type of main disability are in receipt of disabled students' allowances. [198942]

Mr Willetts: Information on students awarded and paid disabled students' allowance is published annually by Student Loans Company (SLC) in the Statistical First Release “Student Support for Higher Education England”. The latest statistics are available at the following link:

http://www.slc.co.uk/media/694170/slcsfr052013.pdf

Information on the disability type for students in receipt of disabled students' allowance is available only at the point of application and so are not included in our routine statistical outputs. The figures provided in the following table reflect the number of applications and do not necessarily correspond to the number of students who were actually awarded and paid.

Data has been rounded to the nearest 10. 2. The data has been derived from analysing free text fields therefore may not be 100% accurate. 3. Count of applicants refers to new DSA applicants in academic year 2012-13 who have been assessed as eligible for DSA. 4. Applications are for new DSA applications received in academic year 2012-13. 5. Total does not add up due to rounding.

The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) collects and publishes data on students at UK Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The number of young (under 21) entrants to UK HEIs who were domiciled in York Central constituency and York local authority prior to starting their course is shown in Table 2. HESA figures for 2013/14 will be available in January 2015. There are differences in the coverage of UCAS and HESA: the UCAS figures cover applicants to HEIs, Further Education Colleges (FECs), and Alternative Providers (APs) of higher education in the UK; the HESA figures cover HEIs only, plus the University of Buckinghamshire. Not all applicants apply via UCAS: some apply directly to institutions. In addition, some applicants who obtain a place via UCAS opt to defer entry until the following year.

Hugh Bayley: To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills how much funding for each (a) undergraduate and (b) postgraduate student the Higher Education Funding Council for England allocated to (i) the University of York and (ii) York St John University in (A) cash and (B) at current prices in each year since 1997-98. [198514]

Mr Willetts: The following table shows the amount of grant distributed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) for teaching and research per full-time equivalent student for each of the years requested. There have been changes in HEFCE's funding methodology over this period, so these tables do not provide like-for-like yearly comparisons. In particular, the data prior to 1998-99 are not available in a similar format to that for later years.
