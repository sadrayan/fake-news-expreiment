Hello again from the PolitiFact Texas project. I write afresh because we’re checking a Beto O’Rourke claim that he takes no PAC money.

It looks to us like his campaign has reported accepting no PAC donations though he drew some fire when a special-interest PAC bundled individuals’ donations; would the center classify such bundling as a PAC donation?

We see too that O’Rourke’s campaign has accepted contributions from political committees for other officeholders or office-seekers. Would these be considered PAC contributions?

Our FEC check suggests that Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign likewise reports no PAC contributions. Would that be fully accurate?

For both candidates, has the center identified supportive PACs perhaps raising money from other PACs to help their respective candidacies? What’s the most complete way of breaking down the PAC money flowing to such efforts?

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

My appreciation and gratitude,

1. We don't consider PAC earmarking/bundling to be the same as a PAC contribution -- I talked to an AP fact checker about this a couple weeks ago, and her story has a pretty good summary of the relevant issues.

2. Campaign committees of other politicians are not technically PACs by the Federal Election Commission's definition, so not a violation of his pledge.

3. Cruz has received PAC contributions -- you can see a summary on our site here. I'm not sure why the FEC says he's raised $0 from PACs when if you look at his paper filings you can clearly see the contributions. It's likely just an FEC error.

4. I'm not sure what you mean by "supportive PACs" -- if you're looking for information on groups spending money independently to support or oppose Cruz or O'Rourke, you can see it on the TX-SEN race page here.

Let me know if this helps or if you have further questions.

Best,

Andrew
