Hillary Rodham Clinton’s White House Schedules

The National Archives and the William J. Clinton Presidential Library released more than 11,000 pages of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s public schedule for her eight years as first lady. There are redactions on more than 4,400 pages, and on many days there is an entry for a “private meeting” that gives no clue as to whom she met or what the meeting was about.
