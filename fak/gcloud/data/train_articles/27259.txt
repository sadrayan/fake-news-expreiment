We are Students, Parents & Teachers for Marshall Tuck
We Support Marshall Tuck for CA Superintendent of Public Instruction!

At a time when we need to prepare our kids for the 21st century economy, California schools rank near the bottom in the nation in reading and math.

Instead of pulling together to fix problems, Sacramento special interests and politicians are putting their own interests first and blocking needed change.

Thatâ€™s why we support Marshall Tuck as our next State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Marshall Tuck will stand up to the special interests and bureaucrats, so we can work together to put kids first, bring fundamental change and accountability to our schools, and ensure every classroom has an effective teacher.
