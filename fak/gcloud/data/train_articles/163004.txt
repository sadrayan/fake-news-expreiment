Read to Lead
Published on Mar 2, 2016

The READ TO LEAD Campaign is a four-year campaign to create a national focus to improve the reading abilities of all South African children.



The campaign is a national response to national, regional and international studies that have shown over a number of years that South African children are not able to read at expected levels, and are unable to execute tasks that demonstrate key skills associated with Literacy. The campaign will provide teachers and schools with clear directives on the Department of Education’s expectations of schools and teachers to achieve the expected levels of performance. The campaign will also ensure that support is provided towards the achievement of the campaign’s objectives.
