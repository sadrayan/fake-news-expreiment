I have not yet come across definitive evidence linking this quote to Dr. King.

I searched the Proquest database, which includes coverage from many newspapers. The earliest newspaper mention of the quote is from 1995. A 17 February 1998 Baltimore Sun article, “Zamora jury fails to reach a verdict,” describes Assistant District Attorney Mike Parrish saying he heard the quote in high school in 1964:

"Dr. King -- that is, Dr. Martin Luther King -- said, ‘Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter,’" Parrish said. "Folks, justice matters. Truth matters. Adrianne matters."

I found a few earlier twentieth-century books with the quote on Google Books, but the previews of the books are limited.

I also searched our Project’s internal database and online resources without any luck.

If I come across an answer, I will let you know; otherwise, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project charges a $125/hour for extensive research requests with no guarantee that the quote will be located.

Good luck with your piece, and thanks for reaching out!

Do you think he said it?

Thanks.

I agree with Dr. Carson that it is possible, but I honestly don’t know.

Kind regards,

Is it possible to check everything you’ve got for King talking or writing March 8, 1965?

Our current work is on Volume 8 of The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr., which covers late 1962-1963, so we have not catalogued the majority of King’s work in 1965. The King-authored documents we have catalogued from that day are letters and telegrams, but I don’t see the quote you are interested in.
