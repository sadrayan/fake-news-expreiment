Naivasha is a market town in Nakuru County, Kenya, lying north west of Nairobi.

Overview [ edit ]

The town has a total population of 181,966 (2009 census).[1]

The main industry is agriculture, especially floriculture.

Naivasha is also a popular tourist destination. Hell's Gate National Park (the main locations for Lion King, including Pride Rock and the Gorge, are modelled after the park[3]), Longonot National Park and Mount Longonot are nearby attractions. Tours also have included Lake Naivasha, to observe birdlife and hippopotamus behaviour, [4] as well as other wild animals.

In the late 1970s–1980s Lake Naivasha was overrun with poachers and foreign creatures introduced into the lake to provide fishing.[citation needed] The migratory paths along lake Naivasha were being destroyed by the local rose industry.[citation needed] Naturalist, Joan Root (1936–2006), spent the last decade of her life trying to save the lake and its wildlife.

A resort in Naivasha was the location for much of the negotiations of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement ending the Second Sudanese Civil War, commonly known as the "Naivasha Agreement".

Transport [ edit ]

It is located on the shore of Lake Naivasha and along the Nairobi – Nakuru highway (A104 road) and Uganda Railway. In 2015, an extension of the new standard gauge railway to this town is approved.[5]
