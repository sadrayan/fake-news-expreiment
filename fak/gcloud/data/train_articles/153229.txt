Conor McGregor v Floyd Mayweather 2 – everything we know so far
Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather’s boxing bout was so lucrative for the pair – both financially and in terms of the attention it granted them – that it’s no surprise to see progress being made over a rematch.

However, unlike the first meeting between the pair, which Mayweather won by TKO in the 10th round, the second bout will see the pair face off in the Octagon.

The UFC was reportedly ready to announce the meeting before former two-weight champ McGregor was involved in a fracas ahead of UFC 223, an incident which left him in hot water with authorities in New York.

However, supposed details of the new fight have leaked, and it might best be described as ‘MMA with a few caveats’ or ‘Boxing Plus’.
