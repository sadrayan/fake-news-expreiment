Northwest Florida Water Management District
Overview

To ensure the fiscal accountability of the water management districts, section 373.536(5)(a), Florida Statutes, authorizes the Executive Office of the Governor to approve or disapprove water management district budgets in whole or in part and directs the districts to submit a tentative proposed budget by August 1 in a standard format prescribed by the Executive Office of the Governor. The statute also requires the submittal of a tentative budget by July 15 each year for consideration by the District's Governing Board. The District prepares a preliminary budget each year, which is submitted by January 15, for legislative review to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairs of each legisliative committee or subcommittee having substantive or fiscal jurisdiction over water management districts, in accordance with section 373.535, Florida Statutes.

Water management districts have the authority to levy ad valorem (property) taxes to support water management activities and must follow the requirements of Chapter 200, Florida Statutes, in regards to setting a millage by resolution of the Governing Board.

Four of the five water management districts are constitutionally allowed to levy ad valorem tax up to one mill. The Northwest Florida Water Management District is limited to one-twentieth of a mill (.05), which is five cents for every $1,000 of taxable property value. For the 2018-2019 Fiscal Year, the District's Governing Board adopted a rolled-back millage rate of .0338, which is less than the 0.0353 assessed in FY 2017-2018 and 32.4 percent below the constitutional and statutory cap of 0.05. The majority of the Districtâ€™s funding comes from cooperative projects, grants, and legislatively-funded programs.
