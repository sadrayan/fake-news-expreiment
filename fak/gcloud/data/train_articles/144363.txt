Community Water Fluoridation
Monitoring Fluoridation in the United States

The number of communities and people who benefit from water fluoridation is continuing to grow. This effective public health intervention was initiated in the United States in 1945. In 2014, 74.4% of the U.S. population on public water systems, or a total of 211,393,167 people, had access to fluoridated water.

CDC monitors the progress of the nation and individual states toward meeting the Healthy People 2020 objective on community water fluoridationâ€”that 79.6% of people on public water systems will receive water that has the optimum level of fluoride recommended for preventing tooth decay.
