Finding Winnie: The True Story of the World's Most Famous Bear: Lindsay Mattick, Sophie Blackall: 9780316324908: Amazon.com: Books
This is the Caldecott winner, Lindsay Mattick is the Great-Granddaughter of the soldier, that rescued what we all have come to know as Winnie the Pooh.....what a delightful story for all Pooh lovers!! I had heard the interview on NPR radio (which I cherish to listen to while in my car). I am a Pooh fan from way back and had never heard this story....I love that Ms Mattick's, narrative is a story she is telling her own son. My only compliant is I didn't care for the illustrator's style, in fact I had first ordered the other book called" Winnie", by Sally M. Walker....I liked the look of Winnie better on the cover..."Finding Winnie's" bear was a little ghoulish to me...and honestly thought the story was by the same author...however, once I discovered my mistake...ordered this book.The story is more detailed....actual photos are on the pages, where the "Winnie" book just have them on the inside book jacket....this will definitely be a great gift for anyone who knows Winnie...even if it is for yourself!
