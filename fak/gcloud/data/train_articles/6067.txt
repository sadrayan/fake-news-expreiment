BREAKING: Texas Church Shooter Was An Atheist On The DNC Payroll
FBI and Texas State Police are both confirming that Raymond Peter Littleberry, the man accused of shooting up a Texas church, was an avid atheist on the payroll of the Democrat National Committee. LLOD correspondent Art Tubolls is on the scene:

“People are saying he wasn’t looking for anything other than to ‘demonstrate that it it science, not some made-up God that decides if you live or die.’ He was apparently trying to maske the point that bullets are more powerful than prayer.”

Littleberry was known in the small Texas town just outside of Arlington as a liberal island in the middle of a conservative sea. He was often the only protester to show up to support BLM after some criminal is gunned down by police. Last year he held a gay pride parade through town to support his homosexual brothers and sisters and he was the only one there.

Littleberry’s frustration grew and he built an arsenal. A law-abiding citizen, nothing kept him from stockpiling. All of that came to a head today as more senseless deaths happened that we can blame directly on godless liberals.
