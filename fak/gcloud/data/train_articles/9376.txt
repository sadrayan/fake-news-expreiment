Tim Canova attacks Debbie Wasserman Schultz on radio
Tim Canova has released three radio ads attacking his primary rival U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston.

The ad "I believe" calls Wasserman Schultz, first elected in 2004, an "insider."

"Sadly, today, she takes hundreds of thousands of dollars from industries like Big Sugar, Wall Street banks, predatory lenders and private prisons. I believe you either represent the corporate lobbyists or you represent the people. You cannot do both."

Here's some background from PolitiFact Florida about her bank donations and position on payday lenders.

The ad "Values" makes some similar claims.

The last ad, "What happened to America?" is similar to a TV ad he released over the weekend.

Two of the ads attack Wasserman Schultz for taking donations from Big Sugar -- a hot topic in Florida right now as a result of the toxic algae bloom. Wasserman Schultz's campaign and leadership PAC have taken $201,450 in donations between 2004-2016, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. She is one of many Florida politicians to take money from an industry that gave about $57.8 million to state and local campaigns since 1994, a Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times analysis found.

Canova, a Nova Southeastern University law professor, is challenging Wasserman Schultz in a Broward/Miami-Dade congressional district in the Aug. 30 primary. This is the first primary reelection challenge she has faced in Congress.
