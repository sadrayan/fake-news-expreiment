Crocodilian Species List
AFRICAN COUNTRIES CONTAINING CROCODILIANS





This map shows the numbers of crocodilian species found in each country, using a colour code (see key). Please note that it does not show the actual geographic distribution of crocodilians - for example, crocodiles in Madagascar are found only in more northerly areas, and not throughout the entire country. For individual distributions, see the maps which accompany each description in the species list. [map created by Rodolfo C. Ferioli]



Africa contains three species of crocodilians, all members of the Crocodylidae family. The most widespread of these is the Nile crocodile which occurs from South Africa all the way up to the southern parts of Egypt, and from Madagascar in the east to Senegal in the west. Populations in the northern parts of West Africa have a reputation for being somewhat smaller than their contemporaries in the less arid and warmer parts of Africa. The other two species found here are the slender-snouted crocodile in West and Central Africa (from Senegal to Zambia) and the African dwarf crocodile also in West and Central Africa (Senegal to Angola). Iran, also shown on this map but obviously not part of Africa, contains a small population of Mugger.
