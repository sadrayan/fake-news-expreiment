Hurricane Matthew Recap: Destruction From the Caribbean to the United States
00:33 Hawaiian Island Begins to Reappear After Hurricane Walaka Wiped it Out Six months after Hurricane Walaka virtually wiped it off the map, East Island is beginning to reappear.

At a Glance Matthew formed near the Windward Islands on Sept. 28, 2016.

It went on to leave a path of destruction from the Caribbean to the Southeast U.S.

On Oct. 9, 2016, Matthew finally moved away from the U.S. coastline and became post-tropical. Matthew formed from a tropical wave that pushed off the African coast in late September. That tropical wave was dubbed Invest 97L just southwest of the Cape Verde Islands on Sept. 25.

It took a few days for that system to organize as it moved westward in the Atlantic. About three days later, however, the system gained sufficient organization to be named Tropical Storm Matthew near the Windward Islands.

Once Matthew reached the eastern Caribbean, it became a hurricane and rapidly intensified. Its peak intensity was late Sept. 30 into early Oct. 1 when it reached Category 5 strength with 160 mph winds.

Matthew then made landfall in Haiti and eastern Cuba on Oct. 4 as a Category 4.

From there, Matthew hammered the Bahamas Oct. 5-6 as a Category 3 and 4 hurricane.

The southeastern United States was then hit hard by Hurricane Matthew as it moved very close to the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Matthew made one official U.S. landfall on Oct. 8 southeast of McClellanville, South Carolina, as a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph winds.

Matthew's U.S. Storm Reports

Storm Surge

On Oct. 7 in Florida, a peak surge of 9.88 feet above normal was measured at an NOS tide gauge at Fernandina Beach, Florida.

Storm surge flooding affected the St. Augustine area, including major flooding on Anastasia Island where water was reported to be 2.5 feet above ground level. To the south in nearby Flagler Beach, Florida, parts of A1A were washed out by the storm surge.

The NWS-Jacksonville conducted a storm survey and found a new inlet was carved between Marineland and Matanzas Inlet, between Palm Coast and St. Augustine Beach, Florida .

The St. Johns River in northeast Florida reached its highest level on record at Shands Bridge, along with 3 to 4.3 feet of storm surge inundation reported at the Racy Point, Red Bay Point and I-295 bridge tide gauges. Early in the morning on Oct. 8, the St. Johns River was flowing backwards.

Matthew's storm surge coupled with high tide lead to a record tide level at Ft. Pulaski, Georgia, early Oct. 8, and storm surge inundation roughly waist-deep was reported in parts of Charleston, South Carolina.

A storm surge of just under 8 feet was recorded at Ft. Pulaski, Georgia, between Savannah and Tybee Island, according to NOAA/National Ocean Service data. Fort Pulaski set a new record tide level of 12.57 ft MLLW (above normal low tide), which occurred two hours after high tide. This beats the old record going back to Hurricane David in 1979.

Tide levels at the Charleston Harbor peaked at their third highest level on record with the morning high tide on Oct. 8, the highest levels, there, since Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and over a foot higher than the early October 2015 flood event. Water was entering homes on West Ashley in Charleston, according to the National Weather Service.

On the afternoon of Oct. 8, water levels were topping 5 feet above normal at Oyster Landing, near Georgetown, South Carolina, and at Myrtle Beach. In southern North Carolina, water levels on the Cape Fear River at Wilmington shattered a record from Hurricane Hazel in 1954 .

The Springmaid Pier in Myrtle Beach was heavily damaged, a section of the Oak Island (North Carolina) pier was also also damaged by waves , and the Jacksonville Beach pier was also damaged .

On the morning of Oct. 9, major sound side storm surge flooding affected the Outer Banks of North Carolina.

Rainfall Reports

Fayetteville, North Carolina, picked up over 8 inches of rain in 6 hours on the morning of Oct. 8 and totaled over 14 inches of rain from this event. As you would expect, major flooding materialized.

The NWS office in Wilmington, North Carolina, issued its first ever flash flood emergency early Oct. 8 for Horry County, including the Myrtle Beach Grand Strand and Conway, South Carolina, due to the combination of rainfall and storm surge flooding. Flash flood emergencies are only issued during rare, exceptionally dangerous events.

Matthew brought widespread flash flooding and record river flooding to eastern North Carolina where hourly rainfall estimates from radar were as high as 7 inches per hour. Buildings were flooded, roads washed out, and sections of Interstates 95 and 40 were flooded in the Tar Heel State.
