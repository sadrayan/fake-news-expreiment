U.s. Warns On Milk Hormone

The practice has surfaced at a time when controversy has raged over the safety and economics of a genetically engineered hormone, bovine somatropin

Enough dairy farmers have been using the cheap but unauthorized hormone oxytocin to stimulate milk production in cows to provoke the Food and Drug Administration to warn against the illegal practice.

(BST), that promises to increase milk production. BST is awaiting FDA approval for commercial use, which isn`t expected before next year.

In the meantime, an undetermined number of dairy farmers have quietly stimulated output on the cheap by injecting their herds with the readily available oxytocin, a natural protein hormone that can legitimately be used for therapeutic purposes. There have been reports of 10 to 12 percent gains at a cost of 20 cents per injection at each milking.

The agency warned veterinarians and farmers that it is illegal to inject oxytocin routinely to boost milk output. The FDA doesn`t consider the use of oxytocin to pose a human-food safety hazard, however, because the drug metabolizes so rapidly that there is no danger of residues occurring in milk. ``Neverthless, since potentially serious animal safety and effectiveness questions remain unanswered, the agency will take appropriate regulatory action when evidence indicates that oxytocin is being used for increasing milk production in lactating dairy cattle,`` the FDA said.

Clell Bagley, extension veterinarian with Utah State University, said he doesn`t believe the use is widespread.

``I don`t understand the gamble, expecially after hearing and reading all the fluff and uproar about BST over the past months,`` Bagley said.

``Flaunting oxytocin at the FDA and media is like teasing a mother grizzly bear; sooner or later she is going to get mad.

``Don`t be surprised when the FDA hangs a few producers and veterinarians as an example,`` he said.

Farmers were warned this month by a respected agricultural publication, the Farm Journal, that they risk losing the goodwill of consumers if they persist in using oxytocin routinely to boost milk output.

``Let`s face it,`` the Journal said editorially. ``Vets make money selling prescription drugs. Dairymen make money selling milk. These short-term economic gains risk not only another food scare, but the dairy industry`s future competitiveness.``

Oxytocin was approved by the FDA in 1972 for therapeutic use in several animal species, specifically for inducing uterine contraction and inducing contraction of smooth muscle cells of the mammary gland for milk letdown.

William Lenschow, a dairy farmer from, Sycamore, Ill., and president of Central Milk Producers cooperative, explained that the udder of a cow under stress becomes rigid and she won`t let the milk out.

``If you don`t treat it with oxytocin, which is effective within two minutes, the cow could develop problems that would have to be treated with other drugs,`` he said. ``It prevents worse problems.``
