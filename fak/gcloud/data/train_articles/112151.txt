Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nomineee, said Thursday he would "love" to debate Sanders as long as the event raised money for charity.

"I'd love to debate Bernie. He's a dream," Trump told reporters in Bismarck, N.D.

“So what we can do, if we can raise for maybe women’s health issues or something — if we can raise 10 or 15 million dollars for charity, which would be a very appropriate amount. I understand the television business very well.”

The Sanders campaign told The Hill earlier Thursday that the Democratic presidential candidate wants to do the debate as well.

The idea was first brought up late Wednesday night on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," when Trump said he'd be willing to debate Sanders. The Vermont senator immediately accepted the offer on Twitter.

A bipartisan debate between the two while the primaries are still ongoing would be unprecedented.
