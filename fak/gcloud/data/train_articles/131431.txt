Nancy Pelosi said "Building a wall will violate the rights of Millions of illegals".UUHhhhh...... Nancy? Illegal Aliens are NOT citizens of the United States, therefore they have NO "rights" to anything in this country.The Democrat Party is ready to shut-down the federal government, because they don't want a border wall....??If the Democrats are willing to shut down government, in order to keep illegals in this country, who the FUCK are they working for ??I vote for my political representatives based on what I feel they will do for me and my country !!I do NOT want politicians who are working for illegals and citizens of other countries, that's not what we're paying them for !!
