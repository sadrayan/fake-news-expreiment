That thing you said about the foxes isn't true, not even in the slightest. Those foxes are tense and have flattened ears; they're most likely fighting/uncomfortable with each other.

oh! I apologies. I guess I got it mixed up, I’m so sorry ^-^;;; yeah I was just basing it off on the sounds, but I guess your point proves more fruitful. that was my bad on the post, I never meant to be offensive or something. I’m sorry
