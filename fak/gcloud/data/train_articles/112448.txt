Burger Tattoo Will Get You Free Burgers for Life, Food Deal
If you’ve ever loved a burger so much you wished you could afford to eat it every day, now’s your chance to achieve your dreams — that is, if the burger is sold at Melbourne’s Cafe 51. The Australian restaurant is offering free burgers for life to customers willing to get a life-size tattoo of any burger from its current menu with its “BURGERLOVE” logo inlcuded in the image.

“Tattoos are for life, so why shouldn’t burgers be free for life too, right?,” Cafe 51 wrote on its website. “It’s simple, pick a burger, any burger from our current menu and get it tattooed anywhere on your body. You are then forever part of our #burgerfamily and you qualify to get this burger absolutely free everyday for the rest of your life.”

There are a few rules, though. Participants must be 18 or older and willing to get a tattoo that is both to scale and able to be shown to store staff on demand.

Registration for the offer will be open on Cafe 51’s website until the end of October, but as of now, the restaurant only plans to select a lucky 10 entrants for the coveted prize, according to co-founder Chris Binos. “After launching the promo online on Sunday night, to date we have had over 3,500 entrants,” Binos told CNBC. “This is way beyond what we expected but testament to our cult following and the bond we have with our customers. We will be selecting the best 10 entrants to get inked.”
