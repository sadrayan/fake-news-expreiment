Illinois GOP: If single moms can’t find the dad, their babies won’t get birth certificates
We’ve removed this post because aspects of the story later turned out to be inaccurate.

From Snopes:

What’s True: HB6064 was introduced as a change to Illinois’ public aid laws and contained provisions that could prevent a single mother from obtaining a birth certificate if she didn’t identify the father of her child.

What’s False: The bill did not prevent all single mothers from obtaining birth certificates, nor was it intended to punish or stigmatize single mothers by preventing them from obtaining birth certificates.
