Explicit memory in pregnant women
OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to systematically investigate previous anecdotal reports of memory decline during pregnancy.

STUDY DESIGN: We used a longitudinal design to investigate memory in women throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Closely matched, nonpregnant women were similarly studied at equivalent intervals. We also assessed degree of depression and anxiety.

RESULTS: There was a significant time-by-group interaction (P < .01 ) for both immediate and delayed recall of paragraph length material. Contrasts showed a significant decline in memory for the pregnant group from the second to the third trimester (P < .01). No significant changes in memory were noted for the control group. The pregnant women scored higher on both depression and anxiety scales; however, somatic rather than cognitive items accounted for the elevated scores. Fluctuations in mood and memory did not coincide.

CONCLUSION: There is a pregnancy-related decline in memory, which is limited to the third trimester. The decline is not attributable to depression, anxiety, sleep deprivation, or other physical changes associated with pregnancy. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:731-7.)
