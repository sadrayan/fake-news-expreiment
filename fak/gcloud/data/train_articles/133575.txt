The Big Laughs of Mexico’s ISIS Threat · Global Voices
According to a video released by the extremist group ISIS (also known as Daesh or ISIL), Mexico is among the 60 countries that are considered its enemies, and therefore could be targeted in new attacks.

Far from showing fear, Mexican social media users have flooded the Internet with sarcastic jokes and dark comedy about the apparent threat, mocking ISIS, its violent ways, and the supposed need to prepare for war with jihadists in Syria and Iraq. With references to Mexican pop culture icons and a lot of the usual local sassiness, Twitter was soon hosting trending hashtags like #ISISenMéxico (“ISIS in Mexico”) and #SiEnMéxicoHubieraTerroristas (“If there were terrorists in Mexico”).

Global Voices collected some of the snarkiest and most popular tweets.

In one video, “Mexican Jihadists” mock ISIS by singing a children's song.

Regarding the readiness of the police and military to combat terrorism, Twitter users expressed a playful belligerence:

Absolutely ready for war…

Others joked that the existing levels of violence in Mexico could present a significant obstacle to ISIS:

#SiEnMéxicoHubieraTerroristas les robarían las bombas y los secuestrarían. — El Candigato Morris (@Oficialmorris) November 26, 2015

If there were terrorists in Mexico, their bombs would get stolen and they would be kidnapped

Tamaulipas, a stronghold State *meme: - ISIS in Mexico - Welcome to Tamaulipas - On second thought, let's take another road

There is now a meme around the concept of “We are ready”:

Elite forces ready for the imminent ISIS in Mexico

Every Mexican when they found out about ISIS in Mexico

Known for making uninformed remarks, President Enrique Peña Nieto was imagined by several Twitter users as capable of confusing “ISIS” for a cable television plan's acronym:

-Señor presidente q opina de #IsisEnMexico -Pues tienen paquetes muy padres pero yo prefiero dish, muchas gracias. pic.twitter.com/MejturGE6b — Malverde (@PachecoVlady) November 25, 2015

- Mr. President, what do you think about ISIS in Mexico? - Well, they have good packages, but I prefer dish

Also, some Twitter users took a more serious approach, addressing politicians’ corruption and the country's drug war, which they say demonstrates terrorism's presence in Mexico already.
