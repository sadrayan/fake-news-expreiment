Marco Rubio: I ‘Disagree’ With Same-Sex Marriage Ruling, But It’s ‘Law’
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) pointed out Friday that while he and others who disagree with the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage ruling must abide by that decision for the time being, the next President would have the power to bring in justices who would protect Americans that support “traditional” marriage going forward.

“While I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law,” the Republican presidential candidate said in a statement. “As we look ahead, it must be a priority of the next president to nominate judges and justices committed to applying the Constitution as written and originally understood.”

Rubio said he disagreed with the court’s majority opinion that same-sex marriage was a matter of a human being’s dignity rather than a question of the definition of marriage. He reiterated that he believes marriage is defined as a union between one man and one woman.

The senator concluded that he hoped both sides of the same-sex marriage debate would “respect the dignity of the other” going forward.
