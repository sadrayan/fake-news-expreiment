Tracking over 3,000 false or misleading claims made by President Trump
“We're having a stock market like just about they've never had before. Ever before. We've picked up... Piers, we've picked up $8 trillion in value during the course of 12 months...” Fact Check: This is a flip-flop for Trump. Before he was elected, he dismissed the stock-market performance under Obama as “artificial” and “a bubble." Moreover, the U.S. rise in 2017 was not unique. When looking at the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, it’s clear U.S. stocks haven’t rallied as robustly as their foreign equivalents. Moreover, with each 1,000-level increase, the accomplishment gets increasing less impressive.

“In Wisconsin, I was very instrumental in getting FoxConn to come. A good friend of mine and a great guy. They make a lot of that Apple iPhones. They are incredible, and incredible company. they are building a fantastic plant.” Fact Check: Trump touted Foxconn's investment announcement, but the company considered investing in U.S.-based facilities since 2014, though its initial plans to invest in Pennsylvania didn't pan out. The deal may not turn out the best for the state: It will take until at least 2043 before Wisconsin earns back the $3 billion payout.

“So we have the biggest tax cut in history, bigger than the Reagan tax cut. Bigger than any tax cut.” Fact Check: Trump’s tax cut is nearly 0.9 percent of the gross domestic product, meaning it would be far smaller than President Ronald Reagan’s tax cut in 1981, which was 2.89 percent of GDP. Trump’s tax cut is the eighth largest tax cut — and even smaller than two tax cuts passed under Barack Obama.

“Now that the individual mandate is officially killed, people have no idea how big a deal that was. It’s the most unpopular part of Obamacare. But now, Obamacare is essentially. … You know, you saw this. … It’s basically dead over a period of time.” Fact Check: While the individual mandate was an important incentive for Americans to seek health insurance, it was only one part of a far-reaching law that remains intact. The repeal does not take effect until 2019, and enrollment in Obamacare has remained strong. The Congressional Budget Office says the marketplaces are expected to remain stable for years.

“Unemployment rates for Hispanics... we have the lowest level ever recorded...Unemployment for women — for women — lowest level in 18 years ” Fact Check: Trump now uses data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate to say this, which is a flip-flop from his previous claims dismissing the BLS unemployment rate as "nonsense." As of this tweet, unemployment claims had risen from their recent low, so the president's claim was no longer accurate to boot.

“Slippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where, by the way, there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!” Fact Check: Trump contradicts himself here. Shortly after firing Comey, Trump told NBC's Lester Holt that the firing was related to the Russian investigation. He also told Russian officials that “I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job...I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off,” according to a transcript of the conversation. Meanwhile, it is false to say the Democrats colluded with Russia.

“DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!” Fact Check: Trump terminated DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, starting the current crisis over whether to extend protections for illegal immigrants who arrived as child with their parents. Democrats came to Trump with a bipartisan plan that had been crafted in the Senate, but he rejected it. The bipartisan proposal had the most support in the Senate but was blocked from a final vote because of GOP opposition. Trump's proposal, which came with limits on legal immigration, received the least support.
