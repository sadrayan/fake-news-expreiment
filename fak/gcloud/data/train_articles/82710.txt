GREAT LAKES WATER LEVELS

Note: In January of 2009, the formula used to calculate the Lake Erie Lake Wide Mean (LWM) was modified to include water levels collected at Cleveland rather than those collected at Fairport. This change was made in order to increase the accuracy of the Lake Erie LWM and will remain in effect for all future calculations.
