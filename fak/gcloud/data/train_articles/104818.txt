Jerry Brown Signs Bill Ensuring Teachers Can’t Shoot Back if Attacked
California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill on Saturday that guarantees that teachers cannot shoot back if they come under attack at school.

The bill, AB 424, was introduced by Assemblyman Kevin McCarty’s (D-Sacramento).

McCarty introduced his bill after five California school districts chose to allow teachers and/or staff with concealed carry permits to be armed on campus to defend themselves and their students. The five districts were Kern High School District, Kingsburg Joint Union High School District, Folsom Cordova Unified School District, Anderson Union High School District, and Palo Cedro’s North Cow Creek School District.

Breitbart News reported that McCarty justified his push to disarm teachers by saying, “A safe learning environment is essential for our children to be successful in the classroom. That’s not possible if a school district allows armed civilians to roam California school campuses.”

The Los Angeles Times reports that the Firearm Policy Coalition (FPC) opposed the bill and the idea of rendering teachers defenseless. The FPC said: “The constitutional right to bear arms is based on the fundamental human right to self-defense. AB 424 undermines these very important principles based on little more than a whim.”

Brown also signed legislation expanding the list of persons banned from gun ownership in California. Newly prohibited persons include those found guilty of misdemeanor hate crimes. That bill is aimed at people “using force or the threat of force to interfere with another person’s free exercise of any constitutional right because of the other person’s race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.”

California has universal background checks, gun registration, and firearms confiscation laws. The confiscation laws include a prohibited purchasers list, which Democrats have been steadily expanding as opportunities present themselves.
