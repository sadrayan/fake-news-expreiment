WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Monday proposed a new regulation for offshore oil and gas rigs intended to improve equipment standards and well designs and avoid a catastrophic spill like the one in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, said that the rule would help modernize oversight of the industry, and that it balanced business interests with environmental concerns. “I believe these regulations will enable us to both grow the economy and protect our resources,” she said on a conference call with reporters.

The Interior Department estimated that the new standard would cost about 90 companies a total of $883 million over 10 years, but officials said many firms were already moving toward compliance on their own and predicted $656 million in net benefits over the next decade.

Democrats in Congress lauded the proposal.

“The worst oil spill in our nation’s history, which is still damaging our families and our economy five years later, happened because of weak safety standards and a lack of industry oversight,” said Representative Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona, the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee. “This long overdue proposed rule helps bring drilling safety into the modern era, and that’s a goal everyone should embrace. American worker health and safety is nonnegotiable.”

The oil industry, which typically chafes at new regulations, has worked closely with the Obama administration on the development of new safety rules since the 2010 disaster.
