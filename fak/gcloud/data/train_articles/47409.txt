London Confronts a Spate of Murders, With Most Victims Killed by Knives
LONDON â€” One teenager was caught in the crossfire of a drive-by attack. Another was shot in the face. They died within 24 hours of each other.

Two days later, another teenager and a burglary suspect were fatally stabbed and a man was beaten to death in what appeared to have been a late-night brawl outside a betting shop.

On Thursday, five teenagers were stabbed in an hour and a half before sunset, including a boy of 13.

All these attacks took place in London over the past week, part of an apparent spike in violence in the British capital. After a long period of steady declines in violent crime, the city has averaged in excess of three killings a week so far this year.

More than 50 people have been killed in London since the start of 2018. The total for all of 2017, a year when the city suffered multiple deadly terrorist attacks, was 116.
