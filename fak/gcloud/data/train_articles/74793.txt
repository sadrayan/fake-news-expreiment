Comparing the Conference Report With the House & Senate Tax Bills
The House-Senate conference committee has released its version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), and we've updated our blog comparing the final agreement with the House and Senate bills.

Table 1 looks at the major policy differences between the three versions of the TCJA. The conference agreement draws from both bills, but overall it is more similar to the Senate bill – particularly it's sunsetting of nearly all individual provisions to get around the Senate's Byrd Rule. In some cases where the House and Senate differ significantly, the conference committee essentially splits the difference, as it does with the mortgage interest deduction. In other areas, the conference agreement actually takes a step backwards from both bills: it retains (but limits) the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes that the House and Senate both eliminate, ignores both bill's changes to the exclusion for capital gains on home sales, and starts the delayed amortization of R&D expenses that lawmakers will likely prevent from going into effect much earlier than either bill.

Overall, the conference bill is more costly than both the House and Senate versions, especially after accounting for gimmicks. We estimate that if all temporary provisions were made permanent, the House bill would cost $1.9 trillion, the Senate bill $2.0 trillion, and the conference bill would cost up to $2.2 trillion. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has not released a dynamic score of the conference agreement, but based on its dynamic analysis of the House and Senate bills, we estimate it would generate around $400 billion in net dynamic feedback, or $450 billion if all temporary provisions were made permanent – not nearly enough to offset its cost.

Table 2 breaks down the fiscal impact of different provisions in the House, Senate, and conference bill. On net, the House-passed bill contains about $1.1 trillion in business tax cuts, $200 billion in individual tax cuts, and $151 billion from eventually repealing the estate tax. The Senate-passed bill includes around $910 billion in net individual tax cuts, $770 billion in net business tax cuts, $83 billion in estate tax cuts; and $318 billion in savings from repealing the individual mandate. The final conference bill contains $1.1 trillion in net individual tax cuts, $590 billion in net business tax cuts, $83 billion in estate tax cuts, and $314 billion in savings from repealing the individual mandate.

Note that for the individual provisions, that the Senate and conference committee sunset most changes after 2025 while the House bill makes most of them permanent.
