Family members have confirmed to our sister station WZTV in Nashville that one of the 50 victims of the Las Vegas shooting was from West Tennessee.

Sonny Melton, a registered nurse from Big Sandy, was attending the Route 91 Harvest festival on the Vegas strip with his wife, according to information supplied to the station.

Melton's wife, Heather Gulish Melton, said she is in complete disbelief.

"At this point, I'm in complete disbelief and despair. I don't know what to say. Sonny was the most kind-hearted, loving man I have ever met. He saved my life and lost his," Heather said in a statement to the station.
