Pope Ends Colombia Visit With Plea for Those ‘Still Being Sold as Slaves’
MEDELLÍN, Colombia — Pope Francis concluded his trip to Colombia on Sunday by visiting the bones of a 17th-century Roman Catholic saint who devoted his life to helping slaves, and whose legacy the pontiff called an example to all for his defense of the poor.

It was the last day of events on Francis’ six-day visit to Colombia, meant as a gentle nudge to the country’s Catholics to forgive crimes committed during a half-century of conflict between the government and the country’s main rebel group, which signed a peace treaty late last year.

The day was not without mishaps. After arriving in Cartagena, Francis knocked his head in the popemobile, leaving his cheek bruised and a small amount of blood on his robes. The injury was minor, Vatican officials said.

But mostly it was an opportunity for the pope to widen the message of his visit, and he made calls to recognize the poor and marginalized worldwide — his papacy’s most familiar theme.
