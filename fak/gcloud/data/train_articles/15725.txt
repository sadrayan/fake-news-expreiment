UNDER PERRY, THE COST OF TUITION FOR TEXAS STUDENTS HAS RISEN

Perry Signed A Bill Allowing Universities To Set Their Own Tuition Rates. “Universities will be able to set their own tuition rates under legislation signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry. The hotly debated bill changes current law that lets the Legislature set tuition rates. The bill was among hundreds of pieces of legislation that the governor's office said late Friday has been signed into law… The college tuition bill was among the higher profile bills that Perry's office said Friday had been signed. Supporters say deregulation is needed to give universities financial flexibility in tough times. Universities were among the hardest hit from GOP-pushed spending cuts used to deal with a $9.9 billion budget shortfall. Critics worried that the change would keep middle-class students out of higher education.” [Associated Press, 6/22/03]

The statewide total academic charges for Texas college students taking 15 credit hours for a semester at a state institution has increased, on average, 104 percent from 2003-2013 to $3,951.
