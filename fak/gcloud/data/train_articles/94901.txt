Calls to action for 0.7% UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, In Larger Freedom (March 2005)

"Developed countries that have not already done so should establish timetables to achieve the 0.7 per cent target of gross national income for official development assistance by no later than 2015, starting with significant increases no later than 2006 and reaching 0.5 per cent by 2009." Commission For Africa, Our Common Interest (March 2005)

"Rich countries should aim to spend 0.7 percent of their annual income on aid, with plans specified for meeting this target ." UN Millennium Project, Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals (January 2005)

"Ours is the first generation in which the world can halve extreme poverty within the 0.7 envelope. In 1975, when the donor world economy was around half its current size, the Goals would have required much more than 1 percent of GNP from the donors. Today, after two and a half decades of sustained economic growth, the Goals are utterly affordable. No new promises are neededï¿½only following through on commitments already made." High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility (December 2004)

"The many donor countries which currently fall short of the United Nations 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) for official development assistance (ODA) should establish a timetable for reaching it.



Among developed countries, achieving or making substantial progress towards the internationally agreed level of 0.7 per cent of GNP for ODA should be considered an important criterion of contribution [in considering reform of Security Council membership]." The Monterrey Consensus (March 2002)

World leaders met at the March 2002 International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, establishing a landmark framework for global development partnership in which developed and developing countries agreed to take joint actions for poverty reduction.



The Monterrey Consensus recognized that significant increases in aid would therefore be needed, and the donor countries committed to provide those additional resources, including the long-standing target of 0.7 percent of GNP:



"We recognize that a substantial increase in ODA and other resources will be required if developing countries are to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives, including those contained in the UN Millennium Declaration. To build support for ODA, we will cooperate to further improve policies and development strategies, both nationally and internationally, to enhance aid effectiveness (paragraph 41).



In that context, we urge developed countries that have not done so to make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7 percent of gross national product (GNP) as ODA to developing countries. (paragraph 42)" Report of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg, South Africa, 26 August-4 September 2002)

"Make available the increased commitments in official development assistance announced by several developed countries at the International Conference on Financing for Development. Urge the developed countries that have not done so to make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance to developing countries."
