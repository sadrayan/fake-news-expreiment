Report Copyright Violation Putin: Obama “Idiot” For Adopting Socialism



“Any fourth grade history student knows socialism has failed in every country, at every time in history,” said Putin. “President Obama and his fellow Democrats are either idiots or deliberately trying to destroy their own economy.”



Economists say Putin’s comments serve to illustrate how worldwide markets have made even economic adversaries dependent on each other’s financial stability.



An Obama spokesman dismissed Putin’s claim, saying, “We’re going to do socialism better.”

Funny, it's labeled as satire on the site. I guess the true believers, such as yourself, will assimilate this into your belief structure.

You're an idiot. That's all. Believe what you want to believe, but remember that belief does not equal truth. You're an idiot. That's all. Believe what you want to believe, but remember that belief does not equal truth.

Not many true Bolsheviks left by then.





[link to wolnapolska.boom.ru]







By around 1990 they were all essentially carving it up for themselves, carving up the state's and people's property that is.



Carving up too much I guess; Yeltsin send Dudayev to Chechnya "because his anti-Communism made him a reliable partner" and 30 000 dead ethnic Russian CIVILIANS and a big economic dyck in the ass later, we know what it led to. It is human greed and stupidity that finished-off Soviet Union - too many pseudo-Communists whose only real purpose in life was to enrich themselves.Not many true Bolsheviks left by then.By around 1990 they were all essentially carving it up for themselves, carving up the state's and people's property that is.Carving up too much I guess; Yeltsin send Dudayev to Chechnya "because his anti-Communism made him a reliable partner" and 30 000 dead ethnic Russian CIVILIANS and a big economic dyck in the ass later, we know what it led to.

Report Copyright Violation Re: Putin: Obama “Idiot” For Adopting Socialism A Right winger just had her letter published in our local paper quoting Putin saying these very words! When satire is believed to be truth and passed on as such, it can be very dangerous and damaging. This paper and this letter writer owes myself and the readers an apology, and I'll do all I can to correct the record.



I'm not an extreme left wing Liberal, but I am a Democrat and I voted for him. I just can't stand for falsehoods to be perpetuated.

Goodbye, halcyon days.



Here is where I look back.

Here is where you fell.

This is where I got up,

Shaking off my tail

This is where your rope trick

Started to look stale.

A greyhound pass for the boy in the well.







There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.



There is another theory mentioned, which states that this has already happened. :putoyum:

Report Copyright Violation Re: Putin: Obama “Idiot” For Adopting Socialism I honestly am utterly baffled why folk aren't out in the street chucking buckets of gas over the socialists and torching them. Millions out of work around the globe, Greece so badly trashed that prostitution is about the only job left in town, slaughter in Iraq, millions homeless from repossessions with Detroit a ghost town... the pain and suffering is beyond imagination and yet these cocky chucks of filth strutt around actually expecting a chance to step in and turn the screws even tighter on our lives.



Socilaists really, really, really are the utter, utter, utter filth at the bottom of the human barrel.

Even Politifact has it as BS. They do give a shout out to GLP though:



As long ago as 2009, it surfaced on Godlike Productions , a site that regularly discusses UFOs and conspiracy theories. While some commenters questioned the quote’s veracity, many lauded it: "Even Putin knows history and he is an intellectual man-with EXPERIENCE. Regardless of his early years in KGB-he seems fairly aware and likely giving sound advice," wrote one user.
