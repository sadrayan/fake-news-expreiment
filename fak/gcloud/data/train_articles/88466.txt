Miami Dolphins chop block Bobby Jindal
The Miami Dolphins had to correct Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Tuesday for wrongly claiming his 12-0 New Orleans Saints could be the first team in league history to go undefeated and win the Super Bowl.

The Saints are one of only two remaining undefeated NFL teams this season, sitting next to the Indianapolis Colts at the top of the league.

The once beleaguered franchise that was jokingly referred to as the “Aint’s” for much of its history are now the toast of Louisiana, something that has not gone unnoticed by Jindal.

“I'm a lifelong Saints fan,” he said in an interview on WWL, a local radio station. “I remember the bad times and the good times, when they were 1-15, as well as this year’s incredible, incredible run.”

Jindal then predicted that the Saints would go “not only undefeated, but all the way through the Super Bowl, something that’s never been done before.”

Only problem is that if the Saints were to win out and claim the NFL championship, they would be the second team to do it – following the 1972 Dolphins, a fact the Dolphins were more than happy to point out.

“With all due respect to Governor Jindal, our fans in Louisiana and elsewhere will be disappointed to learn that he forgot about the most accomplished team in NFL history – the 1972 ‘Perfect Season’ Miami Dolphins,” Harvey Greene, the team’s senior vice president of media relations, e-mailed POLITICO.

“They are the only team in league annals to go undefeated and win a championship, posting a perfect 17-0 record, including a win in Super Bowl VII,” he continued. “We wish the Saints, and the Indianapolis Colts, who are also undefeated, the best of luck in their attempt to match our undefeated season, and we will be the first to congratulate either team if they accomplish that feat. But until then, we remain the only perfect team in NFL history, an achievement our players and coaches rightly are proud of.”
