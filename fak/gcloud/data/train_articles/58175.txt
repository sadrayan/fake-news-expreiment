Timeline: How the Steele dossier was compiled
Christopher Steele is a British former intelligence officer who was hired by the Washington research firm Fusion GPS in June 2016 to investigate Donald Trump's ties to Russia.

Trump has denied the allegations in the dossier. However, the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that the Russians engaged in an elaborate operation to swing the election to Trump.
