Harm Reduction At-A-Glance
O​ur companies have a long history of leading the industry. Today, adult smokers are increasingly seeking new options, including those that address the harm associated with cigarette smoking. They also want products that address social frictions like tobacco smoke and the odor and ash that comes with it.

​That's why Altria offers the most diverse portfolio of tobacco products in the U.S. across the continuum of risk to satisfy evolving adult preferences and convert smokers to lower risk products.

The Role of Nicotine​

Nicotine occurs naturally in tobacco plants. While nicotine is addictive, it's the exposure to smoke – not nicotine – that causes most tobacco-related disease. Smoke from the combustion of tobacco contains thousands of chemicals that cause the vast majority of harm from tobacco, including lung cancer, heart disease and emphysema. ​

Tobacco harm reduction is built on the idea that adult smokers who do not quit should be able to get nicotine from products that are less risky than combustible cigarettes.​

Many smokers find nicotine enjoyable, which is why reduced-risk products need to provide a satisfactory nicotine experience. We recognize that comprehensive regulation of tobacco products is necessary to bring these kinds of products to market and let adult smokers know about them.​
