Kaduna state governor, Nasir El Rufai has come out with a sensational claim to say that president Muhammadu Buhari knows those behind the Zamfara killings while still doing nothing about it, this is a very unusual stance given that the president and governor Buhari never had any falling out before and were infact in good terms and belong to same party. The governor made this claim during an interview with TVC, he claims both the security agencies and the presidency are very aware of this situation - we now eagerly await how the presidency will react to this allegation. We have a video this interview below:

Please listen to the video properly, he said he had access to such information when he was FCT minister. This means that such information is still available to the current minister now and the president has twice that amount of information. In a nutshell, he said all the security chiefs and Buhari has all those information Please listen to the video properly, he said he had access to such information when he was FCT minister.
