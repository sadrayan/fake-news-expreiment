Walker steering $108.7 million of state surplus to rainy day fund
Madison - The state ended the fiscal year in June with a surplus of $342.1 million in its main account and Gov. Scott Walker's administration is depositing $108.7 million into the state's rainy day fund.

The contribution is the largest deposit in state history to the rainy day fund, which has been traditionally ignored by state officials of both parties. A spokeswoman did not immediately say when it would be deposited or how much in total would be in the fund.

The deposit is a significant sum but would be of only limited use in a financial crisis for the state. With the state spending $13.38 billion last year out of its main account, the rainy deposit would be enough to run state government for about three days.

Walker's Administration secretary, Mike Huebsch, praised Walker and other state officials for being "good stewards" of taxpayer money.
