Welcome to Resident Evil 6’s human butcher shop
This is probably the strangest video game marketing stunt of all time.

On September 28th and 29th, this grisly Resident Evil 6 promotional event transformed the famous London-based Smithfield’s butcher shop into the Wesker & Son Resident Evil 6 human butcher shop.

This fake butcher shop sells fake human meat. The menu included delicacies like “J’avo caught human thigh steaks.”

This wacky PR campaign caused quite a stir on the internet and looks utterly disgusting.

Brilliant time @WeskerSon human butcher shop. If you guys have time, go have a look tomorrow and Saturday. Neat #Re6 promo idea! #nohopeleft —
