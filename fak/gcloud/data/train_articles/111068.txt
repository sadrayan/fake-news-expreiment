Holy See Press Office Communiqué
The Investigating Judge of Vatican City State Tribunal today notified the defendant Msgr. Carlo Alberto Capella, his lawyer and the Promoter of Justice of the summons to trial of the defendant at the conclusion of the preliminary phase of the investigation against him.

In the indictment of 30 May 2018, the Promoter of Justice, considering the evidence acquired to be sufficient, had asked the investigating Judge to declare the formal investigation closed and to proceed to summon the defendant to trial.

The investigating judge, considering the matter to fall within the jurisdiction of the Vatican judicial authority – since it regards offences allegedly committed by a public official, albeit abroad – declared the formal investigation closed and summoned Msgr. Capella to trial, by the provision of 7 June 2018.

The offence of which Msgr. Capella stands accused is that of child pornography in the particular cases specified and punished by Articles 10 and 11 of Law No. VIII of 2013 (possession and exchange of child pornographic material, with the aggravating circumstance of the large quantity involved).

The first hearing will take place on Friday 22 June, at 15.00.
