Family, friends and classmates said goodbye Friday to a 16-year-old girl killed in a school shooting in southern Maryland last week.Willey was shot at her high school. Investigators said the teen who pulled the trigger had been in a relationship with her and it had recently ended. The Hollywood Volunteer Fire Department in Saint Mary's County served as a place of tribute as family and friends came to say goodbye. They described Willey as positive, caring and vibrant. Her burial will be private."We really are saddened by what has happened here, and we're here to support the family as well as the broader community, " said Dr. Kathy O'Brien of Walden Behavioral Health.O'Brien is part of the response team that went into action the day gunfire broke out at Great Mills High School. Sheriff's deputies said Willey was shot by 17-year-old Austin Rollins. The bullet also hit a 14-year-old boy in the leg. A school resource officer confronted and fired at Rollins, while Rollins simultaneously shot himself.The violence that ended Willey's life was overshadowed Friday by kind words about her dedication to family, school and swimming."The loss of this young lady, Jaelynn, I didn't know her personally, but everyone who talks about her says she was a positive, loving, caring person with a wonderful life ahead, taken from us way, way too early. We grieve for the family and we grieve for the community, " said Representative Steny Hoyer."Those who are very close to Jaelynn and her family are very affected. There are those who were in the hallways in the schools that are affected, there are teachers affected and the broader community has been affected. So, what I know is we are all going to wrap our arms around them and that we're resilient adn we'll be okay," O'Brien said.The community in St. Mary's County gathered Thursday to remember Jaelynn, who was shot at Great Mills High School by a boy with whom police said she had a prior relationship. She was taken off of life support by her family a few days after the shooting. Willeywas the second oldest of nine siblings.
