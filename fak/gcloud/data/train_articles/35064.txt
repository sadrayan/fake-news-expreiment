No charges filed against Arlington police trainee who fatally shot unarmed teen at car dealership
The shooting sparked protests and became part of the national debate about police officers' use of force against unarmed minorities.Taylor's family is "asking everyone to remain calm and prayerful," Heiskell said."These are decent people who have acted honorably under the circumstances. They deserve a measure of calm," he said. "The case is not over and they still have a chance to obtain some justice."Heiskell said he plans to discuss options with Taylorâ€™s family, including possible civil litigation. He said his attempts thus far to obtain records from the Arlington Police Department have been met with resistance and exorbitant fees.Arlington police spokesman Christopher Cook said the department had no comment on the grand jury's decision. Police Chief Will Johnson fired Miller several days after the shooting, citing several examples of poor judgment.The Arlington NAACP said in a written statement that it was "extremely disappointed but not surprised" by the grand jury's decision."This man walks free for the unjustified death of Christian Taylor," the statement said.Taylor, a graduate of Mansfield Summit High School, was a defensive back on the Angelo State University football team.The shooting occurred after the car dealership's security company reported a break-in.Surveillance camera footage showed Taylor jumping on the hood of a car in the parking lot and peeling away its windshield. He also drove his Jeep through the showroom's glass doors.Miller, who was still doing field training, was one of six Arlington officers who responded to the dealership about 1 a.m.
