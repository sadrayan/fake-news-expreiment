Ask The Senate President Posted 2 days 8 hrs ago



Lifelong Democrat and union member Steve Sweeney is in the midst of the toughest time of his political career. The Senate President joined with Governor Chris Christie and Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver in supporting pension and benefit reform, only to be attacked by union members during rallys against the measure and to have his being a Democrat questioned.



Sweeney will be in studio with Millennium Radio New Jersey's Eric Scott Thursday at 7PM taking your calls at (800)283-1015.
