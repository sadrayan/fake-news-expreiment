Over 200 Skydivers Set Sequential Formations World Record
More than 200 skydivers from nearly 30 different countries recently set a world record and are attempting to beat it again today in Southern California, according to officials.

The diverse group of 202 skydivers, ranging in age from 25 to 70, were caught on video jumping at the same time from nine airplanes 18,000 feet above the ground. Together they formed a starlike shape about 200 feet in radius and then broke apart before linking together again to create a second formation.

The group beat last year's record set by 122 skydivers for the most divers successfully completing two sequential formations in Perris, Calif., according to Nancy Koreen, the United States Parachute Association's director of sport promotion.

Koreen told ABC News that judges onsite confirmed the record, but paperwork documenting the record is still being processed by the World Air Sports Federation, an international skydiving authority based in Switzerland.

The record was set during the 202 skydivers' seventh attempt, according to Dan Brodsky-Chenfeod, 53, a diver in the group and an organizer of the world record attempt. Brodsky-Chenfeod also runs the skydiving center in Perris.

"It was just incredible to have such a great group come to Skydive Perris from all over the world, all sharing their passion for this sport and the goal of setting a world record," Brodsky-Chenfeod, 53, told ABC News. The skydivers came from nearly 30 countries, including Russia, Brazil, Australia and Japan, he added.

"We first came together this past Saturday and started doing small practice jumps," Brodsky-Chenfeod said. "We began the record attempt Monday, and it was on our seventh attempt on Tuesday that we did it."

He added that he and his fellow skydivers would attempt to break their world record again today by completing three sequential formations before landing.
