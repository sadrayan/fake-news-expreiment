Pope Francis Criticized Family Separations Before Policy’s Reversal
They argue that Francis is sowing confusion and leading the church astray with his inclusive interpretation of the gospel. Francis told Reuters that their public campaigning against him was “not ecclesial, but we all make mistakes” and added that he was praying for them.

The pope seems far from chastened by their resistance.

Just this week, the Vatican adopted for the first time the term “L.G.B.T.” because, as Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri explained at a news conference, it wanted to use the language of young people. “We don’t want to be closed in on ourselves,” he said.

In the interview with Reuters, conducted on Sunday but published on Wednesday, Francis added that he also wanted to install more women in high-ranking positions in the Vatican bureaucracy because they resolved conflicts better. He added, however, that he did not want this to lead to “masculinism in a skirt.”

He also disappointed conservatives and some of his critics in the Roman Curia, the body that governs the Vatican, by saying he had no intention of retiring.

“Right now, I am not even thinking about it,” he said. He said he felt in good health, apart from some leg pain associated with a back condition.

The pope also said that he remained optimistic about striking a historic deal with China over the appointment of bishops there, and that he could accept the resignation of more Chilean bishops following a clerical sex abuse scandal that threatened the reputation of his pontificate.

Francis is loath to directly criticize world leaders, especially the American president, after once suggesting while Mr. Trump was a candidate that his enthusiasm for wall building rendered him “not Christian.”
