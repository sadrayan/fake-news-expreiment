DeKalb County Board of Ethics
Welcome The DeKalb County Board of Ethics serves to interpret the Code of Ethics adopted by the county, to apply sanctions to those in violation of the Code, and to issue advisory opinions defining appropriate behaviors according to community standards as reflected in that Code. When complaints are registered against commissioners or other county employees or appointees over whom the Board has jurisdiction, the Board addresses the matter. If appropriate, a hearing will be scheduled and held to obtain evidence on the issue. Should the party accused be deemed to have violated the Code of Ethics, the Board will recommend appropriate penalties or sanctions.
