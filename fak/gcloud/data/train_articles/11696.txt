Donald Trump's Education Plan Would Fire 49,000 Texas Teachers
Donald Trump's education plan to dramatically slash funding for public education would fire 49,000 Texas teachers.

What does that say about Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick, both of whom have doubled-down in their support for Trump?

A new analysis from the Center from American Progress finds that Trump's plan to eliminate the Department of Education would have severe consequences across the country, especially here in Texas. This comes on the heels of a previous report that finds that Trump's economic plans could cause 266,000 jobs lost in Texas.

From CAP's report:

Using official budget figures from the Department of Education, CAPAF’s full analysis shows just how far reaching the impact of Trump’s proposals could be on students, teachers, and families. Our analysis examined the largest programs that the agency runs in order to demonstrate what their elimination would mean for the country and for each state.

The key figures in Texas are shocking: 49,045 teachers would lose their job, and 760,203 students would lose their funding.

That's even worse than student education cuts that Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick have defended in the past - which may explain why they have no problem with Trump's horrible plans for education.
