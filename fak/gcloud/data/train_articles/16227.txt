Subject: Fresh inquiry for fact check

Folks:

I wanted to make sure it’s correct the Texas voter ID law does not permit a voter to present a student ID to vote. It does permit a voter to present a concealed-handgun permit, yes?

Did the Texas law ever permit presentation of a student ID? If so, please elaborate.

While the current law was being reached, did any version of the legislation include a student ID option? If so, please specify.

I plan to complete this fact check today.

Previous to SB 14 going into effect, the law allowed a form of identification with a photo that establishes identity to be used. A student ID, assuming it contained a picture, could be used for this purpose.

Can you guide me to that law – the pre-SB 14 law?

You can see the change in the text of SB14 http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/pdf/SB00014F.pdf#navpanes=0

It’s in Sec. 63.0101.

Is this the old relevant language? Doesn’t mention student ID, but I can see how one would fit under it:

a voter could present a “form of identification containing the person’s photograph that establishes the person’s identity.”

12:50 p.m.

Correct, it doesn’t specifically mention student IDs but a student ID with a photo would be a form or identification that establishes the person’s identity.
