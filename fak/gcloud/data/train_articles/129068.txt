Free fruit for kids at local Kroger stores
A major grocery store chain is trying to promote healthier food choices for children.

Kroger introduced its Fresh Fruit for Kids campaign on Thursday. Four stores around our area are giving free fruit to kids.

Just bring your child into the produce section. Kids under 12 will be able to select a healthy fruit.

Options include apples, bananas, and Clementine oranges.

Johnson City store manager Amy Akard told News 5 WCYB they're better than candy or other sweets.

"Childhood obesity, we read about it every day. It's on the rise so what we are wanting to do at Kroger is wanting to promote a healthier eating lifestyle for children. Hopefully, they can take that to their adult life as well."

Kroger is also hoping free fruit will encourage parents to start talking about healthy eating to children at an early age.

The Fresh Fruit for Kids campaign is being tested in 23 stores. If it's a success, Kroger will open it in 120 stores all across the nation.
