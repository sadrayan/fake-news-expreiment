Celebs to Join Students at March For Our Lives in Washington D.C.
Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, Jennifer Hudson, and Demi Lovato will be lending their support to the student-organized March For Our Lives in Washington D.C. later this month.

The three superstars were confirmed to appear by David Hogg, a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, during an appearance on CNN on Wednesday (March 14).

“We’re gonna have four major independent women that are standing with us and walking beside us, and those are Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson, Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato. They’re gonna be standing there with us and marching with us and they’re some of the few people that are really coming out and stepping up with us.”

The march is a demonstration in support of common-sense gun control, and will take place on March 24.
