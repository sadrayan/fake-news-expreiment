Nevada Youth Risk Behavior Survey

On behalf of the Nevada Department of Education and the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH), the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), School of Community Health Sciences administered the 2013, 2015, and 2017 Nevada Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). The YRBS is a survey of adolescent health behaviors and was designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in cooperation with federal agencies and numerous state and local departments of education and health. Nationally, the YRBS has become the primary source of information on the most important health risk behaviors of high school students and is increasingly used by leading educators, public health officials, and others to improve school health policies and programs.

2017 Nevada YRBS

In 2017, the CDC sampled students from 36 high schools and 36 middle schools in Nevada. To ensure more complete representation from all counties and accurate weighting at the regional level, the DPBH contracted with UNR to sample all regular public, charter, and alternative high schools and middle school in Nevada. A total of 5,336 students from 98 high schools and 5,464 students from 113 middle schools participated. When reviewing the CDC and UNR reports below, please note that the CDC and UNR prevalence estimates may differ slightly because the CDC data are weighted at the state level and the UNR data include regional weighting. For local comparisons, the Nevada reports prepared by UNR should be used.2017 Nevada YRBS Reports

2015 Nevada YRBS

In 2015, CDC selected 32 high schools in Nevada. To ensure more complete representation from all counties and accurate weighting at the regional level, the DPBH contracted with UNR to sample all school districts in Nevada (97 high schools and 5,108 students participated). When reviewing the CDC and UNR reports below, please note that the CDC and UNR prevalence estimates may differ slightly due to these differences in sampling. For local comparisons, the Nevada reports prepared by UNR should be used.YRBS data are routinely collected on high school students, but only a few states collect data on middle school students. In 2015, the DPBH contracted with UNR to sample middle school students from all school districts in Nevada (113 middle schools and 4,535 students participated).
