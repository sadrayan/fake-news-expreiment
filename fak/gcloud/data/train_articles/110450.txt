An swirling ‘dimensional gateway’ opens up over the Large Hadron Collider - and a glowing orb flies into it, in a video hailed as proof aliens are visiting Earth.

The video was posted on YouTube by Section 51 - a UFO fan channel.

Section 51 claims that the bizarre film was captured by American tourists - and warns that the dimensional gateway could summon ‘interdimensional beings with a taste for human flesh’.

Many YouTube commenters suggest that the video could actually be CGI - and it’s worth noting that Section 51 also has a video of Santa Claus flying over New York in a sleigh.

Section 51 says, ‘More people have become more aware of the CERN project aggressive ambitions to explore the unknown ‘dark universe” many have pointed to signs that have people troubled if not terrified by the parade of symbolism used at the CERN facility itself.



‘At CERN headquarters a symbol of Shiva, the (Hindu God of Destruction) dancing the cosmic dance of death and destruction can be clearly seen at the CERN facility. Is this a Symbolic declaration of CERN’s ultimate intention to bring on a new age of destruction to this planet?
