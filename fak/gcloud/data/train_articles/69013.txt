Education

Too many of our children are failing in schools because Florida is failing our children – and blaming our teachers. Every prison cell we build is an indication of our state’s investment in that failure. Yet, Florida’s politicians continue to spend more on prisons and historically allocate less on our public schools. Today, Florida is in 50th place in spending on education.

These backward policies defy all common sense. I believe we need to invest in success up front – in the success of our students, our teachers and our state.

We must invest in futures – not failures. The costs of failing to invest in our children are simply too high- remedial education, high school drop outs on social services, and high prison costs burden our taxpayers and jeopardize our safety and our future as a state.

Together we can create a world-class education system that produces world-class workers. If we invest early and wisely, we will reap the benefits of that investment – in a better educated workforce, one that attracts great companies to Florida and allows us to compete in the South, the nation and the world.

Investing in our Teachers

These days, politicians try to score political points by sanctioning teachers for the failings of our education system. Teachers shouldn’t become victims of politics or be punished because they accept tough assignments in challenging classes. I support Florida’s teachers and I will see to it that they get the training they need to truly improve learning in our classrooms. Under my leadership, we will have meaningful job evaluations that reward the best performing teachers.
