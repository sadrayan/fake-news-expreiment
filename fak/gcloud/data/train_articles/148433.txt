Why Global Citizens Should Care

Inadequate access to clean water and sanitation facilities impacts 1 in nearly 4 schools in South Africa. Vodacom is taking leadership on the issue through its commitment to make pit latrines history by 2030. Join us in taking action here

More than 60,000 Global Citizens gathered in Johannesburg, South Africa, to make their voices heard on a number of issues — from health to inequality — and to witness leaders make financial commitments on the festival stage.

Even as South Africa makes progress towards the Global Goals, not every school in the country provides a safe learning environment, and over the past few years, hundreds of children have drowned in pit latrines.

Global Citizens have taken thousands of actions calling on the private sector to help the South African government eradicate pit latrines.

Global Citizen partner Vodacom has answered the call. Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub announced at the festival that the telecommunications company is partnering with the government to funds its R8 billion sanitation campaign.

“Safety, education, and success of South African children is a top priority for Vodacom.

We find it completely unacceptable that a preventable and fixable issue like pit latrines is holding our children back,�? he said.

Vodacom has shown remarkable leadership in working with the government, NGOs, and communities to help eradicate poverty and inequality in South Africa by investing in education.

Ensuring safety for a brighter future

Nelson Mandela was revered globally for espousing the value of Ubuntu, which a rallying call for everyone to work together towards the Global Goals.

Other than partnering with the government to make pit latrines history by 2030, Vodacom also called on Global Citizens to continue rallying behind sanitation.

Global Citizen ambassador Sho Madjozi is from the Limpopo province, where poor sanitation and pit latrines remain a challenge.

The plight of school children in the province caught national attention four years ago after 5-year-old Michael Komane’s tragic drowning in a pit toilet. In July 2018, a 3-year-old fell into a pit latrine and drowned in the village of Moletji Diteteng.
