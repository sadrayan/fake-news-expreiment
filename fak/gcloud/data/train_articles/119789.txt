Notes

While the Inspection Checkpoint west of Las Cruces is closed sometimes, the one going eastbound near Van Horn, TX never has been when I drove past. This is a mean one; I was stopped there for the better part of a half hour once by a bored Border Patrol agent. Be Warned

From Mark Bozanich:

Branch Notes:

I-310 and I-510 are parts of what was to have been I-410, a southern bypass of New Orleans.

I-10 around the North and East sides of downtown Phoenix, AZ was to have been numbered I-410. I-10 was originally planned to be located further south than it is now located on the west side of Phoenix. I-10 and I-17 were to have met on the SW corner of downtown Phoenix.
