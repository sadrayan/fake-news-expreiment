Kelly for New Hampshire
MANCHESTER – Despite Governor Hassan’s promise to remain focused on her job as the state’s chief executive, the Union Leader reported today that she spent half of April outside of New Hampshire. Kelly for New Hampshire released the following statement:

“When Governor Hassan announced her Senate campaign, she promised that she would be focused ‘each and every day’ on her job as Governor,” said spokeswoman Liz Johnson. “Now, as concerns are raised about her administration’s handling of cases at the DCYF, the disability waitlist, and a stalled hospital crisis unit, Hassan’s absence from the state raises important questions about her engagement on these pressing issues.”
