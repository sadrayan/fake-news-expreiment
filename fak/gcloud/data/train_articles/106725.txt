'Duke' Wayne Fuels Firefighters' Tensions
Although Linson, an African American, did not order the cutout removed, Schriver, who is white, filed a grievance against him, alleging "continued harassment," including changing his parking space.

"The incident over at Carson was about what's appropriate for a fire station," said Schriver, who is on stress leave.

"But Chief Linson completely blew it out of proportion and made it into a racial issue."

Schriver rejected the argument that Wayne's comments in Playboy paint him as racially prejudiced.

"That's one interview from almost 30 years ago, and if that comment is the basis for deeming somebody offensive, then I think that's wrong," Schriver said. "A lot of people do interviews that other people don't like. . . . If that one reason makes him offensive, then that's a weak argument."

Freeman has set up a panel of four outside consultants, including a psychologist, to prepare a report to him on the Carson incident by Jan. 15 as "a confidential and objective way to sort through our issues and see what our priorities should be."
