Faith and Freedom Coalition
Faith and Freedom's 2018 "Road to Majority" Conference a Record Shattering Success!

The 2018 Faith & Freedom Coalition “ Road to Majority ” conference was the largest and most successful to date.



The media and the radical Left are determined to stop the Trump legislative agenda, including the repeal of ObamaCare, ending taxpayer funding of abortion, and the confirmation of conservative judges to the federal bench. We must take this golden opportunity to advance our shared pro-family values in Congress, state legislatures, and local government.



Road to Majority ” featured an array of speakers, unprecedented in modern American political history, including: Vice President Mike Pence, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer, Kellyanne Conway, Charles Krauthammer, Eric Metaxas, and many others.



We hope that you take the encouragement and knowledge gained through three days of speeches, panel discussions, and praise and worship back to your community and continue the fight for our shared values, including religious liberty and the sanctity of human life.
