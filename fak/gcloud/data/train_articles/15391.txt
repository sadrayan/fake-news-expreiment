For the dates Nov. 2005 to Dec. 2011 during Operation Iraqi Freedom, 196 U.S. service member deaths resulted from Iranian Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) which are very deadly improvised explosive devices. It is important to understand that these CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are only a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF. For example, there were rocket attacks and IRAM (improvised rocket-assisted munitions) among other tactics that also contributed to American soldier deaths. Hope this helps but let me know if you have any other questions.

You may attribute the above to the undersigned as a CENTCOM Spokesperson.
