Chris:

We’re fact-checking Sen. Cruz’s claim in the online video ad posted here that Rep. O’Rourke voted against tax relief for Hurricane Harvey victims. This roll-call vote indicates that O’Rourke voted in September 2017 against the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017. I see too that O’Rourke talked about his vote here.

Is there information pertinent to Cruz’s claim that O’Rourke would like to share? I’d be happy to hear back soon by email or phone.

I hope to complete this fact-check today.

We rely on attributable on-the-record information for all our stories.

Thanks,

g.

Not only was Beto on the ground as Rockport, Victoria, Goliad, Port Arthur, Beaumont, Port Lavaca, and Houston recovered from the greatest amount of rain ever recorded in the continental United States but he has voted for robust Harvey relief. This includes working with bipartisan members of Congress to pass disaster relief packages totaling $15.3 billion (HR 601), $36.5 billion (HR 2266), $81 billion (HR 4667), and $90 billion (HR 1892).

Beto voted against the piece of legislation you identified because it dramatically shortchanged Harvey victims by providing significantly smaller tax breaks than those given after Hurricane Sandy. He outlined other reasons for his vote here:

It's also important to note that Senator Cruz voted against over $12 billion for FEMA, including $7.9 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. He also voted against $250 million for pre-disaster mitigation grants, $260 million for flood mapping, and $700 million for firefighter equipment and staffing grants. While Cruz refused to support this funding, Senator Cornyn and Congressman O'Rourke both voted for it.
