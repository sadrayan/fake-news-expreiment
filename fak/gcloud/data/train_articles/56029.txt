No, Donald Trump did not eject a baby
ASHBURN, VA.—If you listened to Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine on Tuesday, or read Politico or the Guardian or any number of other major media outlets, you learned a scandalous fact: Donald Trump ejected a baby from a rally.

Here’s what happened. The baby was one row in front of me, three or four rows from the stage, at Trump’s event at a high school in Ashburn, Va.

Don’t worry, don’t worry. The mom’s running around — don’t worry about it.” People applauded. One minute later, though, the baby began to cry again.

Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trump’s tone is eternally hard to read. But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection — it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mother’s own decision to depart. One other salient fact is missing from all the pieces on babygate. Mom and baby, very much not kicked out, came back to their seat a bit later. The baby was sucking a pacifier, silent.
