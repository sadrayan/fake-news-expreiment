Medical marijuana has no health risks: WHO
The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially given the checkmark of approval to cannabidiol, a relaxing compound in medical marijuana, ruling it is not a dangerous drug.

The compound, also known as CBD, can be an effective treatment for cancer, Alzheimer’s, epilepsy and in palliative care, with WHO now ruling it does not have any risks of addiction.

The ruling means that it should not be a scheduled drug – meaning that it is not a drug that has a high potential for abuse or is illegal to manufacture or distribute.

The WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence announced: “Recent evidence from animal and human studies shows that its use could have some therapeutic value for seizures due to epilepsy and related conditions.

“Current evidence also shows that cannabidiol is not likely to be abused or create dependence as for other cannabinoids (such as Tetra Hydro Cannabinol (THC), for instance).”

The organization is now set to launch a more complete review in May of next year to look into cannabis and cannabis-related substances.

Currently, anyone found possessing cannabis can be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both punishments under UK legislation.

Supplying or producing the Class B drug can land people in prison for a maximum of 14 years, an unlimited fine, or both.

There has long been an argument to legalize the drug to help people with chronic pain and anxiety.
