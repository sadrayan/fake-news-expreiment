The Wage Gap, State by State
Families depend on women’s wages more than ever, but women working full time, year round are typically paid less than full time, year round male workers in every state. Nationally, women working full time, year round typically make only 80 cents for every dollar a man makes and the size of the disparity varies by state. Women fare best in California, where women working full time, year round typically make 89 cents for every dollar their male counterparts make. D.C., New York, and Florida follow California with the ratio of women’s to men’s earnings at 87 percent or more. Women fare worst relative to men in Louisiana and Utah, where women’s earnings represented only 69 and 71 percent of men’s earnings, respectively.
