Sunken Cities: the man who found Atlantis
One day in 1999, the French maritime archaeologist Franck Goddio went diving off the coast of Egypt. He was poised to make the most important discovery of his life.

That day, the visibility of the waters in Aboukir Bay, at the north-western edge of the Nile Delta, was terrible: at a depth of around 20ft, he could barely see more than six inches in front of his diving mask. Yet, after three years of research, in which Goddio had compiled a geophysical survey of the seabed in order to identify the likely locations of several ancient cities lost beneath the waves more than a millennium before, he felt sure that he was in the right place.

Supported by a team of 40, including Egyptologists, engineers and expert divers, Goddio began scouring the seabed. Before long he had spotted the broken shafts of centuries-old red granite columns, protruding from the sediment. Goddio recognised these columns as proof of a significant settlement from antiquity. But he could not immediately be certain that it was Canopus, the specific city he had been hoping to find.

So, the following year, he started excavating another nearby spot. “And then: voila!” Goddio, 69, recalls. “We found the foundation of a very big wall, three metres thick, made of limestone blocks. It was fantastic.”
