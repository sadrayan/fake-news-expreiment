Study targets Patrick Murphy in ranking of least effective members of Congress
Tech company InsideGov last week put out a list of what it's calling the "least-effective members of Congress," and it's got not-so-nice things to say about four of Florida's congressional representatives, including Rep. Patrick Murphy, who's running for the U.S. Senate.

To come up with its effectiveness score, the group looked at the percentage of bills that each member proposed that passed a U.S. House of Representatives committee.

The Murphy campaign has called this methodology into question, pointing to bills the congressman has led through committees in the House, including one in May that he authored. The InsideGov study didn't include bills from the current congressional session, nor did it include bills on which a member of Congress wasn't the lead sponsor.

"The deeply flawed study by InsideGov could not be more inaccurate and misleading," said campaign spokesman Joshua Karp. "Patrick Murphy has passed many bills and amendments, including legislation to fund protections for Florida's environment, cut billions in wasteful spending, and improve transparency in student loans. InsideGov has irresponsibly ignored this good work Patrick has accomplished for his district and Florida."

Here's the Florida congressmen and women who InsideGov say are among the country's least effective:

No. 8: Republican Rep. Daniel Webster, 0 of 6 bills passed committee

No. 9: Republican Rep. Richard Nugent, 0 of 23 bills passed committee

No. 14: Democrat Rep. Lois Frankel, 0 of 8 bills passed committee

No. 21: Democrat Murphy, 0 of 29 bills passed committee

InsideGov is part of FindTheBest, which, according to its website "is a technology company focused on collecting and interpreting data."
