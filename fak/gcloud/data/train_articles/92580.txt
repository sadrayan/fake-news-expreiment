NYS Senate Republicans pitch tax cut for 5 million middle-class taxpayers
SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- The New York State Senate Republicans proposed Wednesday an income tax cut that would eventually save five million middle-income taxpayers $3.5 billion in taxes a year.

The proposal carves out what tax relief the Senate majority wants in the 2016-17 state budget, but it's a one-house bill that would have to win support from Assembly Democrats, and they proposed a different plan last month which included a tax cut for the middle class and a tax hike for millionaires.

Leaders of the two houses of the Legislature are required to pass a budget before the end of the month, but there will be a lot of negotiating with Gov. Andrew Cuomo before then.

Senate Republicans said their plan will provide billions of dollars in tax relief to the middle class, seniors, and small businesses. It would creates a new 25 percent rate reduction for middle class taxpayers, new tax savings to prevent seniors from leaving New York, and significant tax cuts for small businesses, farms, and other job creators, they said.



"For far too long, too many hardworking New Yorkers have had to struggle to make ends meet as a result of taxes that simply put, are far too high," said Sen. Patty Ritchie, R-Oswegatchie. "While we have made progress in putting a stop to endless tax increases, it's still not enough."

Even if all of the Senate plan is not passed as part of the budget, the plan gives Senate Republicans a tax cut platform in a year when all 63 Senate seats are up for election and the Republicans' hold on the Senate majority is at risk.

Senate Democratic spokesman Mike Murphy said, "Everyone wants to lower the tax burden on the working men and women of New York. But we also must get serious about protecting tax dollars. Corruption costs taxpayer money and we must pass real ethics reforms. We also must invest in on our children's education, provide meaningful funding increases for our schools and make sure that we move the economy forward by creating good paying jobs."

Here's the highlights of the Senate Republicans' plan:

Lower taxes for middle class

Beginning in 2018, when existing tax cuts are set to expire, the plan would establish the lowest middle class tax rate in more than 70 years. Instead of jumping to 6.85 percent, the tax rate would be gradually lowered over seven years to 5.14 percent. Five million eligible taxpayers - including more than 770,000 small businesses who file under the Personal Income Tax - would begin seeing savings in 2018. When fully implemented in 2025, middle class New Yorkers would save nearly $900 a year by paying a 25 percent lower tax rate.

Taxpayers eligible for the savings include single filers with taxable income between $20,000 and $150,000; heads of households with taxable income between $30,000 and $225,000; and married joint filers with taxable income between $40,000 and $300,000.

Tax relief for seniors

The Senate would double the amount of retirement income that seniors can exempt from state income taxes. It would provide the first increase since 1981 to the exempt amount of private pensions and retirement income, saving 377,000 senior citizens approximately $361 a year beginning in 2017.

For 35 years, seniors have been able to claim the first $20,000 of pension or retirement income as exempt income. The proposal increases that exempt amount to $27,000 in 2017, $34,000 in 2018, and $40,000 in 2019.

Overall, seniors would save $275 million annually when it's fully phased in.

Small business exemptions expanded

The Senate's tax cut plan will expand the eligibility for small business tax cuts that were enacted in 2013. When fully enacted, small businesses and small farms would save

$494 million annually.

The proposal expands the eligibility of a small business to include any business that files under PIT regardless of how the business is structured; raises the income eligibility threshold from $250,000 to $500,000 when the business entity income is less than $1.5 million; eliminates the employee requirement; increases the exemption from 5 percent to 15 percent for small business income and from 5 percent to 20 percent for farm income; increases the corporate tax threshold from $390,000 to $500,000; and reduces the corporate business income rate for small businesses from 6.5 percent to 2.5 percent over two years.

Eliminating the utility tax surcharge

The Senate's budget proposal would permanently eliminate the utility tax surcharge, or 18-a surcharge, by the end of 2016, saving ratepayers $125 million a year. The surcharge is already scheduled to be phased out by the end of 2017.

The surcharge contributes to New York's highest-in-the-nation energy rates.

Estate taxes

To encourage small businesses and farms to pass down their business from one generation to the next, the Senate proposed speeding up the full phase-in of estate tax reform first enacted in 2014. This would give estates a tax exclusion amount equal to the federal exclusion amount when the estate has farm operations or small business property and where the value of the farm operations or small business are a majority of the estate. Starting April 1, 2016, the exclusion would be increased to $5.45 million, resulting in an annual savings of $70 million and a $210 million cumulative savings by 2020.

An additional 9,000 small-to-mid-sized farms and over 1 million small businesses would benefit due to the change, the Senate majority said.
