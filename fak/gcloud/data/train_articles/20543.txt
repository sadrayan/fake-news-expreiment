Fourth National Climate Assessment
The health and well-being of Americans are already affected by climate change, with the adverse health consequences projected to worsen with additional climate change. Climate change affects human health by altering exposures to heat waves, floods, droughts, and other extreme events; vector-, food- and waterborne infectious diseases; changes in the quality and safety of air, food, and water; and stresses to mental health and well-being.

The first paragraph in each of the following sections summarizes findings of the 2016 U.S. Climate and Health Assessment,1 and the remainder of each section assesses findings from newly published research.

Extreme Events

More frequent and/or more intense extreme events, including drought, wildfires, heavy rainfall, floods, storms, and storm surge, are expected to adversely affect population health.3 These events can exacerbate underlying medical conditions, increase stress, and lead to adverse mental health effects.4 Further, extreme weather and climate events can disrupt critical public health, healthcare, and related systems in ways that can adversely affect health long after the event.3

Recent research improves identification of vulnerable population groups during and after an extreme event,5 including their geographic location and needs (e.g. Bathi and Das 2016, Gotanda et al. 2015, Greenstein et al. 20166,7,8). For example, the 2017 hurricane season highlighted the unique vulnerabilities of populations residing in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other Caribbean islands (Ch. 20: U.S. Caribbean, Box 20.1).9

Box 14.1: Health Impacts of Drought and Periods of Unusually Dry Months In late 2015, California was in the fourth year of its most severe drought since becoming a state in 1850, with 63 emergency proclamations declared in cities, counties, tribal governments, and special districts.10,11 Households in two drought-stricken counties (Tulare and Mariposa) reported a range of drought-related health impacts, including increased dust leading to allergies, asthma, and other respiratory issues and acute stress and diminished peace of mind.10 These health effects were not evenly distributed, with more negative physical and mental health impacts reported when drought negatively affected household property and finances. Drier conditions can increase reproduction of a fungus found in soils, potentially leading to the disease coccidioidomycosis, or Valley fever.3,12 Coccidioidomycosis can cause persistent flu-like symptoms, with over 40% of cases hospitalized and 75% of patients unable to perform their normal daily activities for weeks, months, or longer. Higher numbers of cases in Arizona and California are associated with periods of drier conditions as measured by lower soil moisture in the previous winter and spring.13 Overall, the impacts of drought on hospital admissions and deaths depend on drought severity and the history of droughts in a region.14 Complex relationships between drought and its associated economic consequences, particularly the interactions among factors that affect vulnerability, protective factors, and coping mechanisms, can increase mood disorders, domestic violence, and suicide.15,16,17

Temperature Extremes

High temperatures in the summer are conclusively linked to an increased risk of a range of illnesses and death, particularly among older adults, pregnant women, and children.18 People living in urban areas may experience higher ambient temperatures because of the additional heat associated with urban heat islands, exacerbating heat-related risks.19 With continued warming, increases in heat-related deaths are projected to outweigh reductions in cold-related deaths in most regions.18

Analyses of hospital admissions, emergency room visits, or emergency medical services calls show that hot days are associated with an increase in heat-related illnesses,20,21 including cardiovascular and respiratory complications,22 renal failure,23 electrolyte imbalance, kidney stones,24 negative impacts on fetal health,25 and preterm birth.26 Risks vary across regions (Ch. 18: Northeast, Box 18.3).27 Health risks may be higher earlier in the summer season when populations are less accustomed to experiencing elevated temperatures, and different outcomes are observed at different levels of high temperature.28,29 See Chapter 13: Air Quality for a discussion of the associations between temperature, air quality, and adverse health outcomes.

Vector-Borne Diseases

Climate change is expected to alter the geographic range, seasonal distribution, and abundance of disease vectors, exposing more people in North America to ticks that carry Lyme disease or other bacterial and viral agents, and to mosquitoes that transmit West Nile, chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses.30,31,32 Changing weather patterns interact with other factors, including how pathogens adapt and change, changing ecosystems and land use, demographics, human behavior, and the status of public health infrastructure and management.33,34

El Niño events and other episodes of variable weather patterns may indicate the extent to which the risk of infectious disease transmission could increase with additional climate change.33,35,36

Increased temperatures and more frequent and intense extreme precipitation events can create conditions that favor the movement of vector-borne diseases into new geographic regions (e.g., Belova et al. 2017, Monaghan et al. 2016, Ogden and Lindsay 201631,37,38). At the same time, very high temperatures may reduce transmission risk for some diseases.39,40 Economic development also may substantially reduce transmission risk by reducing contacts with vector populations.41 In the absence of adaptation, exposure to the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which can transmit dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, is projected to increase by the end of the century due to climatic, demographic, and socioeconomic changes, with some of the largest increases projected to occur in North America.31,32 Similarly, changes in temperature may influence the distribution and abundance of tick species that transmit common pathogens.38,42,43

Box 14.2: Transboundary Transmission of Infectious Diseases Outbreaks occurring in other countries can impact U.S. populations and military personnel living abroad and can sometimes affect the United States. For example, the 2015–16 El Niño, one of the strongest on record,44 may have contributed to the 2014–16 Zika epidemic in the Americas.31,45,46,47,48 Warmer conditions may have facilitated expansion of the geographic range of mosquito populations and increased their capacity to transmit Zika virus.40 Zika virus can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fever, rash, and headaches, as well as birth defects. The outbreak began in South America and spread to areas with mosquitoes capable of transmitting the virus, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Florida, and Texas.

Water-Related Illnesses and Death

Increasing water temperatures associated with climate change are projected to alter the seasonality of growth and the geographic range of harmful algae and coastal pathogens, and runoff from more frequent and intense rainfall is projected to increasingly compromise recreational waters and sources of drinking water through increased introductions of pathogens and toxic algal blooms.49,50,51,52,53,54

Projected increases in extreme precipitation and flooding, combined with inadequate water and sewer infrastructure, can contribute to viral and bacterial contamination from combined sewage overflows and a lack of access to potable drinking water, increasing exposure to pathogens that lead to gastrointestinal illness.55,56,57,58,59 The relationship between precipitation and temperature-driven transmission of waterborne diseases is complex and site-specific, with, for example, some areas finding increased numbers of cases associated with excessive rainfall and others finding stronger associations with drought.60,61,62,63,64,65 Heavy rainfall, flooding, and high temperatures have been linked to increases in diarrheal disease62,64,66,67 and can increase other bacterial and parasitic infections such as leptospirosis and cryptosporidiosis.65,68 Increases in air temperatures and heat waves are expected to increase temperature-sensitive marine pathogens such as Vibrio.60,69,70,71

Food Safety and Nutrition

Climate change, including rising temperatures and changes in weather extremes, is projected to adversely affect food security by altering exposures to certain pathogens and toxins (for example, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Vibrio parahaemolyticus in raw oysters, and mycotoxigenic fungi).72

Climate change, including changes in some extreme weather and climate events, can adversely affect global and U.S. food security by, for example, threatening food safety,73,74,75 disrupting food availability, decreasing access to food, and increasing food prices.76,77,78,79,80,81,82 Food quality also is expected to be affected by rising CO 2 concentrations that decrease dietary iron,83 zinc,84 protein,85 and other macro- and micronutrients in crops86,87,88 and seafood.89,90 Projected changes in carbon dioxide concentrations and climate change could diminish expected gains in global nutrition; however, any impact on human health will depend on the many other drivers of global food security and factors such as food chain management, human behavior, and food safety governance.91,92,93,94

Mental Health

Mental health consequences, ranging from minimal stress and distress symptoms to clinical disorders, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and suicidality, can result from exposures to short-lived or prolonged climate- or weather-related events and their health consequences.4 These mental health impacts can interact with other health, social, and environmental stressors to diminish an individual’s well-being. Some groups are more vulnerable than others, including the elderly, pregnant women, people with preexisting mental illness, the economically disadvantaged, tribal and Indigenous communities, and first responders.4

Individuals whose households experienced a flood or risk of flood report higher levels of depression and anxiety, and these impacts can persist several years after the event.95,96,97,98 Disasters present a heavy burden on the mental health of children when there is forced displacement from their home or a loss of family and community stability.99 Increased use of alcohol and tobacco are common following disasters as well as droughts.15,16,100,101 Higher temperatures can lead to an increase in aggressive behaviors, including homicide.102,103 Social cohesion, good coping skills, and preemptive disaster planning are examples of adaptive measures that can help reduce the risk of prolonged psychological impacts.102,104,105
