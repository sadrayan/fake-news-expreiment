State, MPS post improved high school graduation rates
The graduation rate of Wisconsin public high school students reached 87% in 2011, an increase of 1.3 percentage points over the class of 2010, according to data released Thursday by the state Department of Public Instruction.

And although the overall graduation rate in the Milwaukee Public Schools still lagged far behind the state rate, it outpaced the state's improvement, growing to 62.8% from 61.1%.

The new data is based on a four-year rate calculation that counts only students who earn a regular high-school diploma within four years of starting high school. It's the second year that Wisconsin has had to calculate rates in the method, which is required by the U.S. Department of Education.

Twenty-one schools in the four-county metro area posted rates above 95%; among large schools, Waukesha West High School had the highest Milwaukee-area graduation rates, a nearly perfect 99.7%. Whitefish Bay was next among the larger schools, at 99.1% - a significant jump from 95% in 2010.

"Some of the things we're doing now with moving to more projects in class and a greater use of tech nology will continue to help engage students who might be looking at not finishing or dropping out," Waukesha West Principal David Towers said.

At least four Milwaukee County high schools saw graduation rate improvements of at least 8%:

Hamilton High School in Milwaukee: 82.3% in the class of 2011, compared with a rate of 74.6 the year before, a 10% improvement.

Madison Academic Campus in Milwaukee: 65.8% for the class of 2011, an 8% improvement over 2010's 60.9%.

New School for Community Service in Milwaukee: 70.2% for 2011, 14% better than 61.4% in 2010.

South Milwaukee High School: 89.6% for 2011, an 8% improvement over 2010's 82.9%.

Other noticeable improvements: Brookfield East rose from 93.7% to 98.3%, and Greenfield High increased from 87.2% to 91.1%.

Brown Deer's rate was 90.3% in 2011, up from 85.3% in 2010 - but the news was not all good. Black students' graduation rate decreased in Brown Deer in 2011, but a significant increase in the graduation rate for white students resulted in an overall increase.

There were some notable drops as well.

Shorewood High School's rate of 93.8% was a decrease of more than 3% from 2010. Shorewood School District Superintendent Blane McCann said the school had six students who did not graduate on time in June 2011.

"Since the data was reported, three of the six students have graduated," McCann said. "We continue to work with students who end up short of credits, and we help them to graduate during the summer or the following fall."

Old vs. new methods

Wisconsin's average high school graduation rate looks more favorable under the old method the state used for making such calculations. Known as the legacy rate, it counts other students who took longer than four years to finish high school.

The DPI released graduation rates last year using both the new and old calculation method for the state and individual school districts, and did the same again this year.

An example of the difference between the two calculations: The legacy rate for the most recent data shows Wisconsin's students had a 90.5% graduation rate for 2011, instead of the 87% rate for that class under the new method that the federal government considers more comparable among states.

As for MPS, white, black and Asian students all posted graduation rate increases from 2010 to 2011, while Hispanic students' average graduation rate dropped slightly.

"We have much more work to do, but these numbers - along with ACT score growth and growth in 10th-grade state test scores - show that we continue to move in the right direction," MPS Superintendent Gregory Thornton said in a statement Thursday.
