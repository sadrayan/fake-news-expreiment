Gov. Bobby Jindal bemoans higher-education tuition increases as he presides over a state with one of worst records in nation on moderating them
Washington – Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal bemoaned rising tuitions at colleges and universities in an appearance on the Fox News Sunday TV show, according to a report in The Hill — even as he has presided over a state with one of the worst records in the nation on moderating tuition increases on his watch.

“In a lot of states tuition is going up,” Jindal told interviewer Bret Baier. “This is a huge problem nationally.”

Jindal is a candidate for the 2016 Republican nomination for president. His remarks on tuition were included among familiar criticisms by him of Democratic economic policies in general and of the leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton.

Since 2008 — the year Jindal took office as governor — tuition at four-year public universities in Louisiana has increased by an average of 67.2 percent, the fourth-highest rate in the country, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In that same period, Louisiana’s state government cut per-student support for the schools by $4,931, the largest reduction in the nation, the study showed.
