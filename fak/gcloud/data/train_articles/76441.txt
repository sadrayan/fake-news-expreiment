Attorneys General of Virginia
Between 1776 and 1851, the General Assembly elected the attorney general, but the governors filled vacancies, and there was no set term of office. Beginning with the Constitution of 1851 , the voters elect the attorneys general for four-year terms. Attorneys general are eligible for reelection. Should the office become vacant, the General Assembly , if in session, is empowered to elect an attorney general to serve until the next general election; otherwise, the governor appoints a replacement to serve until the next session of the General Assembly or the next general election, whichever occurs first. The only exception was in the period 1865–1870, during Reconstruction (1865–1877), when the commanding general of the military district of Virginia appointed and dismissed the attorney general.

Between 1934 and 1958 the terms of the commonwealth's executive officers expired the day prior to the inauguration of their successors; thus for a twenty-four-year period the dates of term expiration and initiation do not agree. Until the General Assembly in 1956 remedied the discrepancy, with the voters' later approval of a constitutional amendment to take effect in 1958, Virginia was without an executive administration for approximately half a day each inaugural year.
