WASHINGTON — The White House was dressed in pink Thursday night to raise awareness of breast cancer, part of an annual tradition that goes back to President George W. Bush in 2008.

A few hundred people stood outside the fence line at the North Lawn of the White House at sunset, as the White House slowly took on the coral hue.

President Obama has proclaimed October Breast Cancer Awareness Month, an effort to encourage breast cancer screenings to detect and treat the disease early.

"Every year, too many Americans are touched by the pain and hardship caused by breast cancer — a disease that, among women, is not only one of the most common cancers, but also one of the leading causes of cancer-related death," Obama said in his annual proclamation. "During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we honor all those who lost their lives to breast cancer, and we recognize the courageous survivors who are still fighting it."

The annual display usually comes earlier in the month. Thursday's timing coincided with a health care policy speech in Miami Thursday, in which Obama touted the benefits of Obamacare for women.

"The Affordable Care Act has given millions of women expanded access to preventive services, including screening tests such as mammograms, with no out-of-pocket costs," Obama said in his proclamation. "Women can no longer be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, including a family history of breast cancer, and lifetime and annual limits on essential health benefits have been eliminated."
