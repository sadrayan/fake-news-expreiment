California High-Speed Rail Authority
REQUESTS FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST IN INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT

In June 2015, the California High-Speed Rail Authority (Authority) issued a Request for Expressions of Interest (RFEI) for the delivery of an Initial Operating Segment (IOS). The RFEI is neither an attempt at procurement nor a request for private funding. The issuance of the RFEI is a formalized approach for soliciting feedback from the private sector to help plan upcoming procurement(s) for the delivery of an IOS.

As outlined in the RFEI, the next step in this process is to conduct a series of one-on-one meetings with Respondents, which will be held over the coming weeks. The meetings will be conducted in order to discuss and ask questions about the EOIs. Respondents may choose to resubmit their EOIs following the one-on-one meetings, and this web page will be updated with the most current versions.

The Authority plans to use the information in the EOIs to:

Identify opportunities for cost savings and schedule acceleration and the key commercial and financial requirements that would be needed in order to achieve those objectives. Receive feedback from the industry on delivery models that may allow the Authority to meet its objectives. Appropriately inform and update its delivery strategy in its 2016 Business Plan. To schedule and commence one or more procurements in the future.

The Authority instructed Respondents to be mindful of the Authority's statutory and legislative requirements and obligations as described in Proposition 1A, Senate Bill (SB) 1029, Public Utilities Code Section 185030-185038, and in other legislation that governs the Authority's operations.
