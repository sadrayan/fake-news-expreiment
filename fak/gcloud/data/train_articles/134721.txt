Ask federal buildings to stop showing CNN on public televisions
CNN, the formerly neutral but now ​a network with an agenda complicit with the anti-Trump​ camp,​ is a ​ so-called news program that is actively working to ruin your presidency,​ and it​ is playing throughout the day on almost every television screen found in federal office buildings.

You may not realize the subversion of your administration taking place in federal government office buildings throughout Washington D.C.

Please issue an order to the agencies and employees who work for you as Chief Executive of the U.S., that they are to shut off this negative force undermining your presidency. Direct that all televisions play nothing but neutral channels, such as C-Span or The Weather Channel. Even FOX News would be an improvement as FOX is much more neutral than CNN today.
