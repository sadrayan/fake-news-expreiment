Hello from Austin’s daily newspaper where I’m working on a fact-check for the PolitiFact Texas project. The CAIR report available here has been brought to my attention as we review a claim in this news story quoting Omar Rachid, a board member at the Victoria Islamic Center, telling the San Antonio Express-News (my underline and bolding): "The reality of it is that Muslims in America have been subjected to more insults, attacks and hate crimes in the last two or three years than ever before, specifically more than after 9-11,” Rachid said, adding: “Islamophobia is thriving. This is not America. It is not the America I came to 35 years ago.”

What part of your research speaks best to the more-than-ever statement by Rachid?

Any other recommended resources?

Separately, I reviewed the FBI’s posted counts of anti-Islamic incidents from 2010 through 2016. Those counts seem to show a spike in incidents in 2015 and 2016. I did not spot data going back to 9/11. I am pasting below the figures I fetched.

PASTE:

YEAR INCIDENTS % CHANGE (YEAR TO YEAR) 2010 160 xx 2011 157 1.88% 2012 130 17.20% 2013 135 3.85% 2014 154 14.07% 2015 257 66.88% 2016 307 19.46% SOURCE: Annual reports on reported hate crimes, 2010-2016, accessed from website, "Hate Crime Statistics," FBI, web link: https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/civil-rights/hate-crimes undated (accessed July 31, 2018)

We rely on attributable on-the-record information for all our stories. I’d be grateful to hear back soon by phone or email.

Thanks,

g.

The report you linked to is actually an Arab American Institute report.

From 1995 to 2009, CAIR published an annual report on the status of civil rights for Muslims in the United States. After a brief hiatus, during which the organization invested significant resources to improve human resources and case intake, investigation, management, and classification, the annual report was relaunched in 2017.

CAIR’s report from 1995-2009 can be found here: https://www.cair.com/civil-rights-reports

Our most recent reports, from 2017 and 2018, can be found here: http://www.islamophobia.org/research/reports.html

Based on the numbers we report, we have documented more anti-Muslim bias incidents and anti-Muslim hate crimes from 2015 to present than were documented in the year immediately following September 11, 2001.
