What do PWTSA Water Purification Systems do?

PWTSA water purification systems turns surface water sources such as rivers, lakes and dams into a clean, fresh water resource.

PWTSA Water purification also meets the needs of medical, pharmacological, chemical, and industrial applications for clean and potable water. The purification procedure reduces the concentration of contaminants such as suspended particles, parasites, bacteria, algae, viruses, and fungi.

PWTSA Water purification Systems creates the process of removing contaminants from raw water to produce potable water pure enough for human consumption. Our water purification systems are largely used in the following industries: industrial, agriculture, medical and pharmaceutical.

Substances that would have to be removed with our water purification system include suspended matter, colour, odours, parasites (such as Giardia or Cryptosporidium), bacteria, algae, viruses, fungi, minerals (including toxic metals such as Lead, Copper etc.) and man-made chemical pollutants. Depending on the chemical compounds present substances may require additional processes to meet the standards or the end user requirements.



The process of removing undesirable fouling’s, biological contaminants, bacterial matter suspended solids, dissolved and gasses from the water. Often achieved through various processes which may include settling, sanitisation, dissolved air floatation (DAF), media filtration, ultra-filtration nono filtration and reverse osmosis

Methods to Purify Your Water:

Boiling: Boiling water is the cheapest and safest method of water purification. …

Filtration: When using the right multimedia filters, it’s effective in ridding water of the compounds.

Distillation.

Chlorination.
