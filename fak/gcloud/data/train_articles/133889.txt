Lies Involving Voting in TX
First off, if anyone is going to engage in creative writing involving the State of Texas, they need to do their homework to make sure they do not get caught with their pants down. The Wendy Davis supporters who came up with this just got caught in their first flat-out lie and there will be many more to follow, I’m sure. I am going to give you a link to verify what I am about to tell you so I’ll post that first:

If you look at provisions 6 & 7 NOWHERE is it mentioned that both marriage certificates and divorce documents must be presented in order to vote. The story about the judge is also false. These requirements were posted well before the election and she knew what they meant–if she bothered to read them like a responsible judge who keeps abreast of changes in law would. It only took her 15 seconds to sign the affidavit–30 if she read the thing. For her to say she almost “didn’t get to vote” was a fabrication on her part.

The biggest mistake these Democratic workers make when they come here to try to “turn this state blue” is that they truly believe that Texans do not keep up with politics and the news. Well here is the shocker, WE DO! And contrary to what they report, many of us are quite well-educated and know how to think critically.

That being said I am going to make a prediction based on what I do know about the people of my state. Wendy Davis won’t win for TWO simple facts alone. She is NO Ann Richards and to a lot of us, Ann Richards was the last true old-school Democrat. We don’t care for Progressives. The other reason she will not win is that the continuing barrage of lies being printed about my state via operatives of the Democratic Party hurt her more than help her. If they knew how to keep the rhetoric honest, she might have a snowball’s chance in hell of at least getting 28% of the vote. Kinky Friedman would have a better shot than she does, I think.
