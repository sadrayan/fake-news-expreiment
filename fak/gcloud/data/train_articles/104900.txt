Michigan “Sharia Zone” Immediately Bans Bacon, Requires Burkas in Public.
Following the recent decision by Michigan’s 109th Congressional district to adopt adherence to Sharia Law as well as traditional Wypipo Law, County Commissioner Art Tubolls took to the podium to announce further plans : A full-scale ban on bacon within the district, and compulsory wearing of a burka by all females in public.

Indeed, as expected, this news proved controversial. Dearborn’s 200 billion dollar Allah Just’ava’nosh Mosque was surrounded by protesters, and the phone lines were jammed with angry potato pancakes. County Pastor Johnathan Regarp tried to calm the crowd down.

“There is no need to panic. Nothing is really going to change. They make turkey bacon, you know, It’s better for you. And to be frank, many of the women here are probably MORE likely to make a connection by hiding their faces. That’s not me speaking. That’s the Lord. He and Allah are super close.” From L to R : Lord, Allah.

More on this powderkeg as it eventually gels into an explosion of Hummus because of Obama.
