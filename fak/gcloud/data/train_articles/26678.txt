Thank you to our supporters during our first year â€“ 2011
Our Founding

The Foundation for Government Accountability was incorporated as a Florida not-for-profit corporation on June 27, 2011 and received its 501(c)3 status from the Internal Revenue Service in September 2011, effective retroactive to the incorporation date. Our founding, impact and effectiveness could not have been possible without the generous support of our donors.

The Foundation for Government Accountability accepts no government support of any kind and does not perform contract research.

2011 Donors

And numerous other individuals and family foundations who have requested that their generous support not be publicly acknowledged.

The Foundation for Government Accountability asks every donor if he or she would like to be publicly acknowledged and complies with that wish for privacy.

In 2011, less than 2.5 percent of all support for the Foundation for Government Accountability was from for-profit corporations, with 97.5 percent from individuals and family foundations and non-profits.
