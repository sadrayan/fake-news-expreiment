"As President Trump follows through on his campaign promises, our grassroots support continues to grow across the America," said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. "As I travel the country, I see how enthusiastic the hardworking American families are about receiving tax cuts, better jobs, and higher wages and Republicans are committed to creating jobs and spurring economic growth."
