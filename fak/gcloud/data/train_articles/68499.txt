‘This is a lie’: With no dirt on Gorsuch, Tim Kaine resorts to making crap up
What an absurd series of tweets. Ashamed to have you as my senator. Thought you were supposed to be a "moderate." https://t.co/hvdspMlTcD — Ilya Shapiro (@ishapiro) March 29, 2017

Apparently Tim Kaine has decided that it no longer pays to be a pro-life Democrat. So today, the failed vice presidential candidate is coming out swinging for Planned Parenthood:

Today and every day I’m proud to #StandWithPP and the 2.5 million who rely on their care and services #PinkOut — Senator Tim Kaine (@timkaine) March 29, 2017

And that’s why he cannot in good conscience support the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee and he-man woman-hater Neil Gorsuch:

After meeting with Judge Gorsuch & studying his past decisions, I've decided to oppose his nomination. Full statement: pic.twitter.com/0yjyB4znoX — Senator Tim Kaine (@timkaine) March 29, 2017

Judge Gorsuch has taken an activist approach to cases involving a woman’s right to make her own health decisions — Senator Tim Kaine (@timkaine) March 29, 2017

He has cavalierly referred to contraceptive use – a constitutionally protected right for 50+ yrs – as ‘the wrongdoing of others.’ — Senator Tim Kaine (@timkaine) March 29, 2017

He has argued bosses have an individual right to prevent their company's female employees from using health insurance to buy contraception — Senator Tim Kaine (@timkaine) March 29, 2017

Judge Gorsuch’s selective activism in restricting women’s rights is jarring & doesn't demonstrate a philosophy that belongs on #SCOTUS — Senator Tim Kaine (@timkaine) March 29, 2017

That’s quite a bit of ignorance to sort through, so why don’t we just focus on this bit?

Anyone remember that?

Democrats don’t need proof; they only need a megaphone.

@timkaine YOu just made that up. — Richard Allen (@wakefoot) March 29, 2017

Of course he did:

Yeah, that’s definitely not what Kaine said Gorsuch said.

Have you considered not lying? At some point you should say something that isn't a lie. https://t.co/p0KcIy1mdi — Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) March 29, 2017

This is a lie. Or Kaine can’t read. One of the two. https://t.co/aQ3tbvblVw — Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) March 29, 2017

@timkaine This is a deliberate attempt to mislead your audience. — Thad Leach (@thadleach) March 29, 2017

@timkaine cavalierly deceives voters through this intentionally misleading tweet. Saving this one for 2018. https://t.co/3hbT8XrTWU — John Vick (@LTJohnVick) March 29, 2017

@timkaine These statements you are making are misleading and a misrepresentation of fact. We need less of this from our government — Jake Walters (@JakeWalters1776) March 29, 2017

@timkaine disappointing enough to have a president who spreads falsehoods. That men such as you do it — and on this! — is disheartening. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) March 29, 2017
