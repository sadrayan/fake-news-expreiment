Amber Small for Senate
After speaking with parents and educators across the district, it is apparent that improving education for our children is a top priority for all of our district residents. While my husband and I have not yet been blessed with children, and we have not personally experienced these troubles, I have heard from parents of the many struggles their children face in our overly tested and crowded classrooms. As our senator, I will fight for the very best in funding and resources for the families of this district.

As NYS Senator I would advocate for:

- The establishment of community schools in more of our neighborhoods. These schools provide important services to students and their families, leading to greater success.

- Reduced class sizes, which have been proven to have a positive impact on classroom results. Studies have shown that smaller class sizes produce better results than increasing the hours of the school day or extending the school year.

- Advocate for permanent fixes to New York’s failed educational assessments and teacher evaluations. Linking school funding to test scores does nothing to help struggling schools which face a widely different set of challenges than high performing schools.

- Opposition to the tuition tax credit bill and school voucher plans that would divert hundreds of millions of dollars from already underfunded public schools. These policies will result in a tax loophole that won’t benefit the average taxpayer and do nothing to strengthen our educational system.

Clean Water

While cleaning up Albany has been a pillar of my campaign, we also need to make sure we are cleaning up things here at home as well. It is uncomfortable for us to admit that the beach closings and contaminants in our waterways that we experience on a regular basis are in large part from human sewage. This is not a problem we can afford to sit on any longer and I am offering a plan with real solutions. That is why I proposed my CleanNYWater initiative which proposes:

- Recommending an amendment to the New York State Smart Growth law to mandate analysis on sewer infrastructure.

- Creating short term sites such as retention ponds and additional basins to keep excess sewage out of our drinking water.

- Developing a financial mechanism for communities struggling with CSO issues to assist in financing investment in new sewer systems.
