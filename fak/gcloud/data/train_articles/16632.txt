Dr. Nielsen-Gammon:

It’s been a spell. I write anew as we review for PolitiFact Texas an Austin weathercaster’s claim that May 2018 marked the 401st straight month of global temperatures exceeding the 20th century average. Weathercaster Jim Spencer tells us he reached that conclusion by relying on the information posted here by NCEI.

How would you assess the accuracy of this claim?

Any concerns or caveats regarding the statement or the information posted by NCEI?

What does the number of straight months of temperatures exceeding last century’s average mean?

Other recommended research sources?

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information. I am trying to complete our review by midday Wednesday.

Thanks for taking a hard look, time permitting,

The statement is true, based on the NOAA global temperature analysis.

There are several different global analyses, which may vary in stations used, corrections applied, and spatial interpolation. I've checked four of the most prominent ones. NOAA happens to have the longest streak of temperatures above the 20th century average, which may be why that particular statistic seems to be quoted most often with the NOAA data.

Other ongoing streaks are: 399 months (HadCRUT4, NASA, since Feb. 1985) and 308 months (Berkeley Earth, since Sept. 1992). They're all in the same ballpark for these particular months: -0.16 to -0.01 in Dec. 1984; -0.06 to +0.02 in Feb. 1985; -0.01 to +0.06 in Sept. 1992 (all temperature anomalies in C, multiply by 9/5 (but don't add 32) to get F anomalies).

HadCRUT4 provides confidence intervals: the last month whose 95% confidence interval included 0.0 was Nov. 1992. For Berkeley Earth, the last such month was Feb. 1994, with 291 months since.

So speaking scientifically, it has almost certainly been at least 291 consecutive months of global temperatures above the 20th century mean, and probably much longer, with 399 or 401 months being the best estimates. If you believe the NOAA estimate, it's 401 months.

What this means is that average global temperatures have increased so much that not even natural variability can produce a month colder than the 20th Century average, and hasn't been able to do so for some time. The global warming signal is well above the noise level. At this rate, about the only thing strong enough to cancel out global warming for a month would be a volcanic eruption much stronger than Krakatau.

People can and will derive broader meanings from this information.
