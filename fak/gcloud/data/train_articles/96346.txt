WisPolitics.com: Burke Campaign: Mary Burke statement on Equal Pay Day
4/8/2014CONTACT: Joe Zepecki, Communications Director608-622-7698; press@burkeforwisconsin.comMADISON - Former Trek Bicycle Executive and Democratic Candidate for Governor Mary Burke released the following statement today, to mark Equal Pay Day:"Following Scott Walker's repeal in 2012 of protections against gender discrimination Wisconsin is now one of just five states without an equal pay law. Women deserve equal pay for equal work. It's just that simple. In Wisconsin, a woman only earns $0.80 for every dollar a man earns - and pay discrimination doesn't just hurt our families - it hurts our economies too. When women bring home equal pay for equal work it strengthens our middle class and overall economy. That's why reinstating Wisconsin's 2009 Equal Pay Enforcement Act is a part of my jobs plan, "Invest for Success."Equal Pay Day marks how far into the next calendar year the typical woman would have to work to make what the typical man made the previous calendar year.
