Ramsey Orta says he was poisoned at Rikers in lawsuit
STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Ramsey Orta, the man who videotaped the police custody death of Eric Garner in Tompkinsville, claims in a lawsuit that rat poison was put in his food while he was incarcerated at Rikers Island.

The lawsuit -- filed on Wednesday in Bronx Supreme Court against the city Department of Correction -- claims that Orta suffered "severe personal injuries" when officers poisoned his food in March as payback for capturing the fatal altercation between NYPD officers and Garner at Victory Boulevard and Bay Street across from Tompkinsville Park on July 17, 2014.

An additional 19 inmates are suing because guards allegedly spiked their meatloaf.

"The plaintiff sustained severe personal injuries, was rendered sick, sore, lame and disabled, sustained severe nervous shock and mental anguish, great physical pain and emotional upset, some of which injuries are permanent in nature and duration," the lawsuit alleges.

According to the suit, Ramsey will "incur further hospital and/or medical expenses in an effort to be cured of said injuries; and plaintiff has been and continues to be unable to pursue the usual duties with the same degree of efficiency as prior to this accident."

According to a Daily News report, the lawsuit contradicts statements made by Ramsey's aunt and an activist in April, when they said he didn't eat the food in fear he would get sick.
