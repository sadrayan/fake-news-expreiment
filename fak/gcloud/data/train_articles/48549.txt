Who really benefits from GOP’s tax overhaul is battle point as House passes its bill
Rep. Kevin Brady:

So, one thing a lot of people, because of all this sort of circus a bit on the media, they don't really yet, I think, get a chance to take a hard look at this.

And when they do, they realize, because the income rates are lower, the AMT is gone, the new family credit and standard deduction, they end up in very good places as families.

Now, can we do better? I think the answer is yes. In fact, we continue to work with lawmakers from the high-tax states. And, again, those local governments and governors, they just brutally tax them. And, frankly, it's just — it's just hard to watch.

But we think we can provide tax relief for Americans, regardless of where they live, including in these high-tax states. So we got work to do. And I'm kind of excited. You know, we pivot right to it.
