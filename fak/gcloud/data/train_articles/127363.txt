Philly riots: Eagles fans set fires, flip cars after Super Bowl win (photos, video)
Philly riots

Thousands of Philadelphia Eagles celebrated the NFL team's first ever Super Bowl victory Sunday night, and some of the fun turned violent.

Videos and photos show looting, cars overturned, street lights toppled, fires set, fights, and extensive property damage. More than a dozen people fell when they climbed on top of the Ritz-Carlton hotel awning and it collapsed.

The Philly police scanner even included reports of police horses stolen, an off-duty cop arrested, bottles thrown, assaults, and people setting off fireworks. There was even an unconfirmed rumor that an ostrich had been stolen from the local zoo.

It's unclear how much damage occurred, and numbers aren't immediately available for arrests and injuries. Most of the incidents occurred along Broad Street in Center City, where fans young and old chanted "Fly Eagles Fly" in an area packed with green and white jerseys for nearly half a mile.

Quarterback Nick Foles led the Eagles to a 41-33 win over the New England Patriots in Minneapolis for the franchise's first Lombardi trophy. A parade will soon follow, commemorating the Pennsylvania city's first major pro sports championship since the Phillies won the 2008 World Series.
