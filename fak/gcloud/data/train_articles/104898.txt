BREAKING: Sarah Huckabee Sanders Is Being Replaced
Rumor has it that Sarah Huckabee Sanders has lost the confidence of the President and will be replaced. No, not by Stormy Daniels. We apologize for the cover photo, our site was hacked by a feminazi liberal named Amanda

Sanders, who showed she has no clue what’s actually going on, has been ineffectually moping about the press room for a few days now not even bothering to try. According to our source in the West Wing

“Sarah knew all about Trump’s lies on Stormy and told the American people the wrong story. As far as the administration is concerned, the entire Stormy Daniels debacle now falls on her.”

There’s no official word yet when Sanders will be escorted out of the building with a box of things they let her keep or who will replace her. Some conservatives are pushing for Kim Davis to deliver a daily prayer instead of a press briefing since they accomplish nothing anymore anyway.

Real Americans get their news fro President Trump’s Twitter
