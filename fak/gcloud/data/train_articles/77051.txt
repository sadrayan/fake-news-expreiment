Executive Orders and Presidential Proclamations, 1933-1936 | Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library & Museum
This is a digitized version of the Franklin D. Roosevelt portion (1933-1936) of a large series of Executive orders and Presidential Proclamations (1862-1936), compiled by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and microfilmed by the National Archives. Original presidential Executive orders and Proclamations are part of the General Records of the U.S. Government, Record Group 11. Numbered Executive orders after 1936 are printed in the Code of Federal Regulations and are not included in this collection. All records are arranged by date and there is a subject index to the Proclamations.

Executive orders are official documents, numbered consecutively, through which the President of the United States manages the operations of the Federal Government.

Roosevelt's numbered Executive orders dated after 1936 are available online at http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/roosevelt.html. Also, the following link provides access to the edited and re-arranged text of Presidential Proclamations and Executive orders from April 13, 1945 to January 20, 1989: http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/.

The text of Executive orders appears in the daily Federal Register as each Executive order is signed by the President and received by the Office of the Federal Register. The text of Executive orders beginning with EO 7316 of March 13, 1936, also appears in the sequential editions of Title 3 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

A numerical list (volume 1) and a subject index (volume 2) to numbered Executive Orders 1-8030 (1862-1938) are available in the two-volume publication Presidential Executive Orders (New York: Hastings House, 1944), which was compiled by the Historical Records Survey of New Jersey under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration (WPA).
