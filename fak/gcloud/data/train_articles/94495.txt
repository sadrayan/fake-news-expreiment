Policy :: Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Todd Staples
“Over twenty million Texans and people across the globe depend on Texas agricultural producers to provide a safe and reliable food and fiber supply. As Commissioner of Agriculture, my priorities are to ensure urban, suburban and rural Texans benefit from sound policies protecting property owners’ rights, promoting clean water and air, balanced nutritional programs, and a solid business environment to process and deliver goods. I am fighting to represent the interests of farmers and ranchers, consumers and processors of the State of Texas.”
