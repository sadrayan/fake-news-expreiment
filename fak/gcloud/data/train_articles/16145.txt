Claim: Dan called for an increase in Gas Tax:

Response: The claims that Dan Patrick supports raising the gas and sales tax are intentional misrepresentations of the truth. In a speech he said he was opposed to any bill that placed a gas tax burden on just one county. He had opposed the bill to increase the gas tax on just Harris County. He said if there was a gas tax increase it should be a statewide increase and not on a county by county basis. However, he was opposed to the statewide tax as well. He was making the point that if the legislature ever increased the gas tax that's how it should be done.

With that said Dan has never supported legislation that increased the gas tax and he continues to push for using the vehicle sales tax revenue to better fund our transportation infrastructure.

Claim: Dan called for increasing the sales tax:

Response: This is an intentionally misleading attack by Dewhurst. Since 2006 in his first campaign Dan has said we should shift some of the burden from property taxes to fund education to using sales taxes. He has consistently supported lowering the property tax by expanding the sales tax. The burden on property owners is too great and conservatives have long advocated for lowering them in favor of expanded consumption taxes which would lower the over-all tax burden on Texans.
