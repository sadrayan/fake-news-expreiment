DCCC CHAIRMAN LUJÁN ANNOUNCES FIRST ROUND OF RED TO BLUE CANDIDATES & MAJORITY MAKER DISTRICTS
DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luján today announced the first round of 11 candidates to earn spots on the DCCC’s highly competitive Red to Blue program. Additionally, he announced Majority Maker and True Blue districts.

This first round of candidates have earned a spot on Red to Blue by surpassing aggressive goals for grassroots engagement, local support, campaign organization and fundraising. Beyond their demonstrated abilities to build a winning campaign infrastructure, these candidates have strong records of service, authentic messages that connect with voters, and deep ties to the communities they aim to serve.

In 2018, the DCCC will make more targeted and frequent additions to the Red to Blue program than in previous election cycles.

“The House is in play in 2018 and incredible Democratic challengers are stepping up to run across the largest offensive battlefield in a decade,” said DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luján. “These candidates have their own unique experiences rooted in these districts, but what they all have in common are records of service to their communities and our country.

Luján continued, “It’s still early in the cycle, but there’s no question that these candidates are building strong campaigns, energizing the grassroots, and raising the resources necessary to win in tough districts. Candidates are our best asset, and that’s why I’m proud to announce the first round of our battle-tested Red to Blue program.”

Red to Blue is a highly competitive and battle-tested DCCC program that arms top-tier candidates with organizational and fundraising support to help them continue to run strong campaigns. Additionally, the DCCC provides strategic guidance, staff resources, candidate trainings, and more.

Throughout 2017, the DCCC has focused on allowing candidates to build strong relationships with voters and allies on the ground. Toward that goal, the Committee has provided support to all Democratic House candidates willing to have open lines of communication and work collaboratively with the Committee.
