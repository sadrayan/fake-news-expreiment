Republican Governors Association launches TV ad attacking Barbara Buono

The Republican Governors Association today unveiled a TV ad going after likely Democratic nominee Sen. Barbara Buono in the New Jersey governor’s race.

Though Christie’s primary campaign has more than twice as much money as Buono, outside groups have already begun to play an important role in the race. A Democratic group called One New Jersey has already spent $1.8 million on ad attacking Christie, and Election Law Enforcement Commission executive director Jeff Brindle has estimated that an additional $15 million more might be spent by outside groups by November.

Here’s the RGA’s script: “As a Trenton politician, she voted to raise taxes 154 times. Under her, property taxes up 70 percent. Backed a 16 percent sales tax increase. Utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins, gyms – She taxed them all. Architect of Corzine’s budget, she drove New Jersey $2 billion into debt. Barbara Buono by the numbers: taking New Jersey backwards.”

Some added commentary from RGA communications directors Gail Gitcho: “After failing to recruit any of their top choices to run, Democrats are now stuck with Barbara Buono’s record of voting to raise taxes 154 times while overseeing out-of-control spending. Barbara Buono’s failed policies of higher taxes, increased spending and deeper debt would take New Jersey backwards and erase the progress Governor Christie has accomplished.”

Response from Buono’s communications director, David Turner: “Gov. Christie and his national Republican sponsors’ false attacks on Sen. Buono’s record are attempts to distract from the truth: they have made careers off defending millionaires over working and middle class families. Sen. Buono has consistently fought to make millionaires pay their fair share to provide property tax relief to the New Jersey’s middle class.”
