Justin Timberlake, Jessica Biel, Jennifer Aniston and more do lunch with Hillary Clinton
Who needs Leonardo DiCaprio to host a $3.34-million fundraiser when Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake are waiting in the wings and more than willing to take the reins?

For the record

12:51 p.m., Aug. 24.: An earlier version of this article reported that $33.4 million was raised at the lunch. The amount was $3.34 million.

Hillary Clinton mixed with A-list donors in the Hollywood Hills on Tuesday at Casa de Timberbiel, where a big-money lunch for 100 people was moved after DiCaprio backed out of hosting duties suddenly over the weekend.

“Look who came over for lunch... #imwithher,” Biel said on Instagram, captioning a strip of black-and-white photo-booth photos that featured her mugging with Timberlake and the Democrats’ nominee for president.

Composer and classical pianist Chloe Flower managed to get a snapshot of Biel and Timberlake as they addressed the fundraiser guests and introduced Clinton.

Jennifer Aniston and Clinton posed for a snapshot taken by Tobey Maguire’s wife, jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer, and Justin Bieber’s manager Scooter Braun documented his participation along with pregnant wife Yael Cohen Braun and son Jagger.

Meyer, daughter of NBCUniversal Vice Chairman Ron Meyer, also gushed about the candidate in a caption on a shot of herself talking to Clinton at the event. “[S]uch an honor to stand beside you (even though my heart was pounding out of my chest!) xo,” she wrote.

Also on hand: Jamie Foxx, who had been partying with Rick Ross, Chris Brown and DJ Khaled on Sunday in Miami while Clinton was coming off a daytime fundraiser in Rhode Island that featured Cher speaking her mind bluntly about Donald Trump, expressing, among other profanity-peppered comments, a desire that the GOP nominee simply “fall off the face of the Earth.”

During a three-day tear through California, Clinton had eight fundraisers calendared, including a cocktail-and-appetizer backyard reception for hundreds of people — including Samuel L. Jackson — hosted by Magic Johnson on Monday afternoon. On Monday night, a $50,000-a-head dinner for 100 was held at the home of producer Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl.

In an email over the weekend, according to Page Six, DiCaprio had cited a conflict with production on his climate-change documentary, “Before the Flood,” as the reason for ditching the Notorious HRC.

However, there was also speculation that his absence had something to do with his charitable foundation being linked to a $3.5-billion Malaysian embezzlement scheme — per the Hollywood Reporter — that allegedly used the U.S. banking system to launder proceeds that were skimmed from government coffers in that part of the world. Some of that money, an FBI task force alleges, went to bankroll a production company involved with “The Wolf of Wall Street.”

DiCaprio himself is not targeted by the FBI investigation, THR said. But it seemed to be a lousy weekend in general for the Oscar winner: He and girlfriend Nina Agdal were in a car accident Saturday in the Hamptons, People reported.

The actor’s Range Rover reportedly hit a Mini Cooper but nobody appeared to be hurt, the outlet said. And Leo got a chance to comfort his supermodel girlfriend.
