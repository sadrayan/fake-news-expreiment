Blue Jersey:: A Tale of Two New Jerseys!
Our unemployment rate is still higher than the national average. The Governor has cut large amounts of state aide to our municipalities and to our schools over the past two years. He removed the State from the coalition suing for spoiling our air on the eastern seaboard. He took us out of RIGGI. He took away property tax relief. He took all the state dollars away from women's reproductive health centers. And now he wants to borrow dollars to pay for infrastructure improvements. He has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system, and then states that the system is broke.

So here's a few things I'm thinking about where "we" are now as compared to two years ago. More of New Jersey children are in poverty. Some 215,000 households (one in 15) received food stamps last year - a more than 23% increase over 2009. In 2009 13.5% of children lived in poverty and in 2010 there was an increase to 295,346 children or 14.5% of children in poverty.
