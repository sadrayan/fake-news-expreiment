Beer In Ads #635: Budweiser, Aren’t You Glad
Friday’s ad is our fifth and last ad for this week from Budweiser’s long-running “where there’s life … there’s Bud” series. This one’s from 1957 and is another where the woman looks like she’s kissing, rather than sipping, the beer, as the man watches oer her, smiling, with the empty can in his hand. At least he’s not still pouring it, which is the case in so many of these ads.
