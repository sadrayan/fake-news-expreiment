Police report gives new details in twelve-year-old's murder
SAVANNAH, Ga. (WJCL)- A police report obtained by WJCL states that Keith Passmore, 12, was fatally shot while sitting inside a pick-up truck on Vicksburg Drive.

The report says the boy sat inside the truck with Christopher Martin, 20, outside of a house party. That’s when a black male, dressed in all black, approached the truck, banged on the passenger door and said “open up.” Martin told the boy to not open the door and started the vehicle. That’s when the gunman opened fire, and Martin hit the gas. Martin said that once he reached Skidaway he yelled to the boy, who didn’t answer and was slumped over in the passenger seat.

Neighbors on the street recall the night saying, “”yeah there were 6 to 8. One person said six. She said 8,” said Gary McKee, neighbor. “And then there was the squealing of the cars. Cars were racing off as if to get out of here and that was just about it.”

One woman who lives about six homes away, but did not want to give her name, found a bullet hole in her fence the next morning. “It ricocheted off there and then hit that blanket. The police want to know what that blankets made off because it cradled the bullet.”

Passmore attended Myers Middle School and only lived three minutes from the spot where he was murdered. The victim’s mother tells WJCL news that Passmore was shot in the head. He will be buried in Baxley and funeral arrangements are pending.
