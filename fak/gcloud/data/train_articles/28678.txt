Read prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's memo about the Kavanaugh-Ford hearing
In a memo sent to all GOP senators, Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell — who was hired by Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee to ask questions of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford during last week's hearing — said she did not believe "a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Committee," per NBC News.

The other side: Democrats condemned Republicans' choice of Mitchell, arguing that it created a judicial setting for the hearing — when neither Ford nor Kavanaugh was on trial.
