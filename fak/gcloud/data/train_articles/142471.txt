Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV), Hawaii, USA
Located in the Puna district on the Big Island in Hawaii, Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) is the only geothermal power plant in the state. PGV is comprised of two air-cooled power plants, a combined cycle system and a binary system, with a total generating capacity of 38 MW. The facility includes several features that make it environmentally friendly including: noise reduction enclosures a low-profile, small-footprint design; near-zero emissions; 100% geothermal fluid reinjection; and, continual monitoring measures.

PGV commenced commercial operation in 1993. It was acquired by Ormat in June 2004. Over the years, Ormat has increased the output of the Puna power plant by upgrading the plant through resource development and with the addition of a bottoming OEC in 2011.

The PGV power plant sells its electrical output to Hawaii Electric Light Company under three long-term power purchase agreements.
