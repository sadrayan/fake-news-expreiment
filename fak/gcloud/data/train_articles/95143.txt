About the Program
E-Verify is an electronic program through which employers verify the employment eligibility of their employees after hire. The program was authorized by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). In short, employers submit information taken from a new hire's Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification Form) through E-Verify to the Social Security Administration and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to determine whether the information matches government records and whether the new hire is authorized to work in the United States.



E-Verify is administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, USCIS, Verification Division, and the Social Security Administration. The USCIS Verification Division is dedicated to providing program support, administering unparalleled customer service to both employers and workers, developing innovative technological solutions, and performing community outreach to further the mission of E-Verify. By extension, we facilitate federal agency and employer compliance with U.S. immigration law.
