Clinton Announces Key Senate Panel Backs $200,000 for YWCA of Niagara
Washington, DC – Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved $200,000 for YWCA of Niagara under the FY 06 Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill. The funding will go towards outfitting a state-of-the-art computer lab and classroom at their Carolyn’s House site.

“Women who are homeless or who are the victims of domestic violence are among the most vulnerable members of our society and I salute the work that the YWCA does every day to help those who are in need. As an invaluable asset to the community, the Carolyn’s House program at the YWCA will help even more young women and their families and I am proud to support them with this funding,” Senator Clinton said. “My hope is that the development of this computer center will make a real difference in the lives of young women who use its services.”

The YWCA of Niagara’s Carolyn’s House project aims to provide semi-permanent housing to homeless women and children, primarily victims of domestic violence. Other services to be provided at Carolyn’s House, located at 542 Sixth Street, will be employment and training programs promoting occupations with a living wage, on-site extended hours day care, case management, financial literacy training, parenting classes, individual and group counseling and GED classes.

Specifically, the funds approved today will be used to equip a state-of-the-art computer lab and classroom that will include twenty computers, printers, desks, supplies, educational software programs and audio visual equipment. This classroom will serve 48 women annually.
