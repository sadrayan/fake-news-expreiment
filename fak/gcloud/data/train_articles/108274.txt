Denmark: Creating proactive policies supporting vulnerable children and their families
Additional tools

The Danish welfare state pursues equal opportunities for all citizens through a number of services and benefits. The Danish family policy is designed in such a way that it prioritizes the principle of a ‘dual-earner’ family and the system thereby supports equal rights between women and men. Besides investing in universal services and benefits, most sectors aim at promoting targeted measures to ensure adequate living conditions for all, e.g. social housing, equality in health policies, prevention of abuse etc.
