Subject: RE: Fresh inquiry, poverty rates, Texas

Is there pre-1959 data and is there a year-by-year chart for the states and nation?

10:08 a.m.

There is no pre-1959 data (the poverty rate concept didn't originate until the early 1960s I believe). There is no such year-by-year chart -- what I sent is the extent of what we have.
