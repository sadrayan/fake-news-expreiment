Harald I | king of Denmark
Harald I, byname Harald Bluetooth, Danish Harald Blåtand, (born c. 910—died c. 987, “Jumne,” Den.), king of Denmark from c. 958? to c. 985, credited with the first unification of the country.

He was the son of Gorm the Old, the first significant figure in a new royal line centred at Jelling (North Jutland). Harald completed the country’s unification begun by his father, converted the Danes to Christianity, and conquered Norway. After Harald’s Baptism (c. 960) his father’s pagan tomb was transformed into a Christian place of worship with a church between two great mounds; and the newly appointed Jutland bishops, under the Archbishop of Hamburg, organized the country’s conversion. The Trelleborg type of fortifications date from his reign. The expansion begun by Harald in Norway was continued by his son Sweyn I, whose war with his father marked Harald’s last years. After Sweyn conquered England in 1013, his son Canute ruled over a great Anglo-Scandinavian kingdom that included parts of Sweden.
