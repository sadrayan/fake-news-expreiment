Deacon on Katko: ‘He’s no moderate’
Local Democratic officials helped open a new Hillary Clinton election office in Syracuse on Saturday. Clinton recently called on every Republican in office to say if they agree with recent Donald Trump comments. Trump said U.S. generals have been reduced to rubble under President Barack Obama and Trump praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. Colleen Deacon, a Democrat running against Rep. John Katko (R-Camillus) in the 24th Congressional District, called on Katko to voice his opinion.

Deacon says she does not agree with the idea that Katko is a moderate Republican.

“He is somebody who when he ran he said he was tough on crime prosecutor but he was somebody who won’t even support common sense gun legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists," Deacon said. "He’s somebody who said he was going to focus on jobs and hasn’t focused on jobs at all in this district. He’s somebody who when he ran said he promised he wouldn’t vote to defund Planned Parenthood and since he’s been in office he’s done that four times.”

One recent Katko campaign TV ad questioned if Deacon could be an independent voice if she is elected. Deacon said she has been working with Republicans in the district for more than 12 years.

“I worked closely with Congressman Richard Hanna, a Republican in our neighboring district," Deacon said. "I actually worked with Congressman Katko when I was in Sen. Gillibrand’s office. I have a record of working with anybody.”

Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner and Assemblywoman Pam Hunter also offered their support for Clinton and Deacon at the new election office.
