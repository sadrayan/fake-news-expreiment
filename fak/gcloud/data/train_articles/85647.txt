Judith Collins slammed for retweeting fake news
The internet is having a ball with National's Judith Collins Trump-like behaviour.

The former Justice Minister's attracting flak for calling on the Prime Minister to denounce news - that happens to be fake, and from a dodgy website.

Judith Collins tweeted a link to yournewswire.com, tagging in Jacinda Ardern.

The site is well-known for running stories that have been well and truly debunked.

Is @jacindaardern willing to denounce this legislation of child sexual abuse? https://t.co/6YMlJiO8zr â€” Judith Collins (@JudithCollinsMP) August 6, 2018

This story claimed France had passed a law protecting paedophiles against rape charges.

The Herald's Matt Nippert pointed out to the minister the site was famous for telling porkies - such as pop star Katy Perry promoting cannibalism.

In response, Collins doubled down, saying: "then she won't have any trouble denouncing it - will she?"
