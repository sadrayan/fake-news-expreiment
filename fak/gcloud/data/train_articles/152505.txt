Fyre Festival: discussion about the upcoming festival in The Bahamas
Hi everyone, I am a research assistant for a professor at Northwestern University who is researching deceptive marketing techniques, the Fyre Festival in particular. We are trying to understand the role and effect social media influencers had in advertising the festival.

If you have the time, please fill out this brief survey ( < 1 minute) if you attended or considered attending. There is an open ended question in the survey if you have any feedback or other thoughts, would love to hear them.

If you didn't attend the festival but know someone who did, PLEASE send this to them. It is greatly appreciated!

cheers
