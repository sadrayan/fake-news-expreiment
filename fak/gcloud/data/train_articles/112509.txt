11 IVF babies to be delivered on 11-11-11 in city
SURAT: A city-based In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) centre will undertake operations on 11 would-be mothers to schedule the births of their babies on Friday, 11-11-11.

About 30 women had conceived through IVF nine months ago at the 21st Century Hospital in the city. Of them, 11 couples wanted the delivery of their babies on the special date.

The operations will be performed by Dr Purnima Nadkarni and Dr Pooja Nadkarni and their team of doctors at the hospital from 6 am. All the 11 women who conceived through IVF have waited a long time for this moment. The eldest woman is 43-year-old, who insisted that she wanted to deliver her baby on the special date.

Dr Pooja told TOI, "We started preparing for the operations on Friday. It is going to be a hectic day for us as we have not performed these many operations in a single day."

She said the 11 angels, who will arrive in this world on Friday, will give hope to innumerable couples in the diamond city and across the country that infertility is not an incurable problem.

"In the last four-and-a-half-years, the centre has helped about 1,200 couples to conceive through IVF and ICSI technology," Dr Pooja added.
