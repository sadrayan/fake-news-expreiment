This tweet looks pretty real, doesn't it?

It's not, though. I faked that tweet using a Web service named "Let Me Tweet That For You." It's pretty simple -- you type in a Twitter username and a message, and it generates a realistic-looking image of a tweet from that person. It even adds fake retweet and favorite counts to lend some more credibility.

The site is a project of OKFocus, a New York-based marketing agency. It's actually about a year old, but has been somehow rediscovered this week and is really taking off on Twitter.

Compare that image above to a screenshot of a real tweet:

That should be a bit scary for journalists and anyone else concerned about potential hoaxes. Of course, it would be pretty easy to debunk one of these fake tweets if you just visit the person's actual Twitter profile to see if the tweet really exists.

But what if it's passed off as screenshot evidence of an allegedly deleted tweet? Much tougher to disprove. Proceed with caution.
