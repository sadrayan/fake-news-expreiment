Wolters Kluwer's Blue Chip Economic Indicators Panelists Anticipate a Rebound in Real GDP Growth and a Rise in Interest Rates at FOMC June Meeting
Ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) June meeting, 100 percent of the Blue Chip panelists predict an increase in interest rates. "The Federal Reserve is likely to assume that the recent softness in economic growth and inflation will prove to be transitory," said Randell E. Moore, executive editor of Wolters Kluwer's Blue Chip Economic Indicators. "The consensus anticipates that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at the June meeting."

Other consensus findings from the June issue of Wolters Kluwer's Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey include:

In addition to a June rate hike, an additional 25 basis point rate hike by the end of this year is expected by about three-quarters of the Blue Chip panelists.

The consensus forecasts of year-over-year and Q4-over-Q4 real GDP growth in 2018 remained at 2.4 percent for a sixth consecutive month.

The consensus forecast of car and light trucks sales in 2017 fell for a third straight month and are now expected to total 17.0 million units.

The odds that Congress will approve any tax cuts or big infrastructure investment plan by the end of this year continue to fall and are now less than 50 percent.
