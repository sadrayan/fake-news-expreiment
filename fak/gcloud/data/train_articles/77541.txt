US Military Under Attack – Religious Liberty in the Armed Forces Attacked from Within
The Family Research Council is out with a new report detailing specific instances of the United States military cracking down on religious freedom within its own ranks. The report catalogs a decade long timeline showing the increasingly hostile stance of the US military towards the free exercise of religion.

This report includes an account where the Houston National Cemetery began preventing Christian prayers from being said at military funerals. It also includes an account in which the Pentagon directed a military base in New Jersey to take down a video simply because it mentioned “God.”

Have we really gotten to the point where the military can’t even use the word “God” anymore? Will banning US servicemen and women from reciting the Pledge of Allegiance be next?
