President Obama on his decision to attend a baseball game after the Brussels attacks
Hours after the deadly terror attacks in Belgium, President Obama attended a baseball exhibition in Havana, where he joined the crowd in observing a moment of silence.

Then, during the game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban national team, the president joined ESPN for an interview.

"This is just one more example of why the entire world has to unite against these terrorists," Obama said. "The notion that any political agenda justifies the killing of innocent people like this is something that is beyond the pale. We’re going to continue with over 60 nations pounding ISIL. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those whose live have been lost and hope for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured."

Obama, who sat with Cuban President Raúl Castro during the game, said he decided to watch baseball even after the attacks because the "whole premise of terrorism is to disrupt people’s lives."

He recalled the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, saying one of his "most powerful memories and proudest moments as president was watching Boston respond."

He referred to Red Sox slugger David Ortiz’s defiant statement about how strong Boston was, about how the city was not going to be intimidated — “perhaps the only time America was not upset about someone cursing on TV,” Obama said.

"That’s the resilience and strength we need to show in the face of the terrorists," he said. "They cannot defeat America. They don’t produce anything. They do not have a message that appeals to a majority of Muslims and people around the world. What they can do is strike fear and disrupt our daily lives and divide us."
