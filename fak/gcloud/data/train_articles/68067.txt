History Facts About the Capitol's Architect George Browne Post (1837 - 1913) started his career in 1858 after graduating from New York University with a degree in civil engineering. For two years, he studied architecture at the New York Studios of renowned architect Richard Morris Hunt.



In 1868, after a stint as an Army Officer in the Civil War, he opened his own architectural firm.



Post was part of the late 19th century architectural movement that pioneered the use of steel to make taller and stronger structures and several of his building's showed up on Manhattan's skyline. Although many do not stand today, they included the 20-story Pulitzer Building (1889-90); also known as the World Building and the 26-story St. Paul Building.



Post also participated in Chicago's Columbian Exposition in 1893, an important showcase for American beaux-arts style architecture. It was that exposition that fueled his desire to create "America's Grandest Monument" which he nearly constructed as a museum of history on the Hudson River in New York. Although that project never materialized, Post used a similar design, four proportional wings and a central dome, when designing the Wisconsin Capitol in 1906.



Post supervised much of the Capitol's construction as well as its interior design, but he died in November 1913, at the age of 76 before its completion. His sons - William S. and James O., who had joined their father in 1904 to form George B. Post & Sons, finished the project.



State Capitol Time Line 1836

On July 4, 1836, the Wisconsin Territory, previously a part of the Northwest, Indiana and Michigan territories, is organized at Mineral Point. The first Legislature meets at old Belmont (now Leslie, Lafayette County) on October 25, 1836, in a building rented from John Atchinson. It is a two-story, attic-framed building, forty-two feet by twenty-five feet, with a square battlement front. This building is preserved in its original state and is on the National Register of Historic Places.



1837

A long struggle takes place at Belmont over the location of the permanent seat of government. Finally Madison, then merely a town on paper, is chosen through the influence of James Duane Doty, a former federal circuit judge. The prospective town received its name in honor of James Madison, the fourth president of the United States.



In 1837, construction begins on the new Madison Capitol. Stone for the first Madison Capitol is from Maple Bluff and is ferried across Lake Mendota to the foot of North Hamilton Street. Also, oak used in the building is locally harvested from Gilman Street in Madison. The first Madison Capitol is of substantial size and compares favorably with contemporary capitols of adjacent and older states and territories. The cost of Wisconsin's first Madison Capitol is $60,000.



1857

After twenty years, the first Madison Capitol proves inadequate for the growing needs of the State. To relieve crowded conditions at the Capitol, the Legislature of 1857 provides for its replacement. The construction work on the second Madison Capitol begins in the fall of 1857 and continues until 1869, when the dome is completed.



1882

The Legislature of 1882 appropriates $200,000 for the construction of two wings on the north and south sides of the original building. The two wings are added to the Capitol building to allow for additional space for the State Historical Society, the Supreme Court, the State Library and increased legislative staffs.



The completed structure measures two hundred and twenty-six feet from east to west and three hundred and ninety-six feet from north to south. From the base of the building to the top of the flagstaff, the height is two hundred and twenty-five feet. The general plan of the Capitol at this time is that of a cross, with two corridors intersecting at the rotunda. The cost of the second Capitol, including the additions and park improvements is $900,000.



1903

Again the Legislature realizes that the Capitol building is not able to fully serve its purpose, so it appoints a Building Commission to consider the construction of a third new and larger Capitol building in Madison.



1904

The Building Commission hardly begins its initial assignment when the February 27, 1904 fire destroys a large part of the interior of the Capitol building. At this time, a new and larger Capitol becomes a necessity.



1906

In 1906, the Legislature directs the Building Commission to select an architect, secure plans and proceed with the construction of a new Capitol. The Commission approves the plan of George B. Post & Sons of New York. However, the financial limitations imposed, along with the necessity of housing government during the erection of the building, results in extending the construction over a number of years and in building it one wing at a time.



Construction of the west wing, which was the most heavily damaged area from the 1904 fire, is undertaken first. Work to rebuild the west wing starts late in 1906. The west wing is completed and made ready for the Legislature in 1909.



1908

The east wing construction begins and is completed in 1910.
