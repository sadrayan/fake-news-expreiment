Education
Empowering Parents, Students, and Teachers

Coming from a family of public school educators, I know the best education decisions are made as close to the classroom as possible – between the parent, teacher and student. I have fought tirelessly for successful educational programs, like Head Start, and worked to end top-down federal curriculum models, like Common Core, that come at the expense of the autonomy of local school boards and parents who are best suited to craft educational plans for students.

Last year, I worked with my colleagues to end funding for federal Race to the Top grants, which require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding. And this year, I strongly supported the reforms included in the House-passed Every Student Succeeds Act, which restructured the federal government’s role in our education system that was put in place by No Child Left Behind. This bill places power back in the hands of states and local school boards, allowing teachers and parents, not the federal government, to determine how best to meet students’ needs.
