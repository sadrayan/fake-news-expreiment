Syria has declared 41 facilities at 23 chemical sites where approximately 1,300 tons of chemical precursors and agents and 1,230 unfilled munitions were stored, the chief of the global chemical weapons watchdog has said.

Ahmet Uzumcu said in his first report to the Security Council, obtained by AP, that inspectors overseeing the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile had corroborated information provided by Syria at 37 of the 41 facilities.

Inspectors did not visit two sites because of security risks, which meant an October 27 deadline to visit all declared sites was missed. Inspectors are still expected to meet a November 1 deadline to destroy Syria’s capacity to produce chemical weapons - except possibly at those two sites, according to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
