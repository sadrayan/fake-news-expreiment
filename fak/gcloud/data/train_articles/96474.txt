Women's Law Project
Insurance Insurance discrimination against victims of domestic violence In 1994, in partnership with the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the Law Project began its ongoing effort to stop insurers from discriminating against victims of domestic violence. The impetus for this work was the denial of health, life and mortgage disability insurance to a Pennsylvania woman because of medical records revealing an incident of domestic violence. Our advocacy began with administrative and legislative efforts to stop such discrimination in Pennsylvania and expanded to assuming a leading role in efforts nationwide to stop discrimination against victims of domestic violence. At present 41 states have legislation prohibiting insurance discrimination against victims of abuse and efforts continue to insure comprehensive legislation at the state and federal level. (See recent success, Governor Signs Act 78). Federal legislation to stop insurance discrimination is essential to comprehensive coverage The wide disparity of anti discrimination laws adopted in 41 states has created a patchwork of inconsistent protection throughout the country, leaving many unprotected.

36% of all employees who receive health insurance coverage through employment-based plans are in self-funded plans which are governed by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and therefore exempt from state law protections Contact your federal legislators to ask them to support Senate Bill 1136 and House Bill 2395.
