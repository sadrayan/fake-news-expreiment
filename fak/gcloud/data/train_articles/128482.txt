Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990 to 2013
Globally, there were an estimated 289,000 maternal deaths in 2013, a decline of 45 per cent from 1990. The global maternal mortality rate (MMR) in 2013 was 210 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, down from 380 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990. However, hidden within these figures are enormous inequalities: The MMR in developing regions was 14 times higher than in developed regions.
