CNN Sues Trump Administration for Barring Jim Acosta From White House
CNN sued the Trump administration on Tuesday in an effort to reinstate the press credentials of its chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, escalating a dispute that has highlighted the increasingly tense dynamic between President Trump and the news media.

In a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court, the network argued that the removal of Mr. Acosta’s White House press pass constituted a violation of his First Amendment rights to freely report on the government. CNN also asserted that the administration had violated Mr. Acosta’s due process rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment when it revoked his credentials without warning.

Mr. Acosta, who has frequently clashed with Mr. Trump, angered the president at a formal news conference last week with questions about immigration and the special counsel’s investigation. The CNN correspondent would not give up the microphone after Mr. Trump tried to move on to another reporter.

Hours later, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, announced that the administration had removed Mr. Acosta’s credentials, which allowed him access to the White House grounds. The administration falsely claimed that Mr. Acosta had placed his hands on a White House intern who had tried to take his microphone away during the news conference.
