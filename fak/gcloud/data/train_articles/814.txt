Americans for Prosperity: Proposed Solar Policies are Not Free Market
Group begins education effort to inform Floridians about rate hikes

TALLAHASSEE – Americans for Prosperity (AFP) today held a press conference in Tallahassee with a coalition of free market organizations to refute claims that proposed solar policies are free market policy. AFP explains that the proposed policies result in government favoring solar energy industries over other energy providers, and will result in electricity rate hikes. AFP – Florida state director Chris Hudson explained:

“Some people think that certain proposed policies floating around Tallahassee are free market policies, when they are anything but. Requiring traditional utility companies to give their grid space to solar energy will impose a massive cost on these providers, which will be passed onto Florida consumers in the form of higher rates. Changing our constitution such that “it shall be the policy of the state to encourage and promote” equals subsidies and mandates by another name – not a free market policy. Installing solar panels and using solar power in one’s home or business is already legal. If promoters of solar really want to encourage a free market, they should focus on deregulating the utility market as a whole, not demanding that existing companies share limited grid space with an inconsistent power source.”

AFP pointed out that in Louisiana, similar net metering policies have resulted in rate hikes and did not result in solar becoming any more economically viable. While AFP does not oppose solar technology, it points out that solar power is not dependable and grids that try to incorporate solar power end up requiring additional traditional energy facilities in order to meet demand when solar panels do not produce sufficient wattage.
