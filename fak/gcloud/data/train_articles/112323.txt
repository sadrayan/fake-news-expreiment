Dr. Sebi Dies In Police Custody In Honduras
According to several news outlets, world renowned natural herbalist and healer Alfredo Darrington Bowman, better known as Dr. Sebi, died in Honduras over the weekend[August 6, 2016] after having complications while battling pneumonia in police custody. He was 82 years old.

Dr. Sebi was originally arrested on May 28, 2016 at Juan Manuel GĂˇlvez de Roatan Airport on charges of money laundering along with his associate Pablo Medina Gamboa while attempting to board a private plane headed to another location in Honduras with $37K in cash.

He was released pending a court hearing days later[June 3, 2016], only to be re-arrested by the Public Ministerio, which is the equivalent to U.S.’ FBI on money laundering charges. Despite his health condition, Sebi remained in custody until the last, but unsuccessful attempt to save his life when he passed away in transit to Vicente D’antoni Hospital.

An ongoing investigation is currently underway in regards to Dr. Sebi’s passing and any evidence of foul play has yet to be confirmed.

Born in Honduras, Sebi never attended formal school, yet studied herbs from around the world and their effects on the body, developing a unique approach to healing with herbs that is firmly rooted in over three decades of hands on experience.

Dr. Sebi is survived by his 17 children.
