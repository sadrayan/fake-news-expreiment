THE DONALD TO DEVELOP CONDO TOWER IN WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.
Real estate mogul Donald Trump is working with Westchester, N.Y.-based developer Louis Cappelli on a luxury condominium tower to be known as Trump Tower at City Center. The project is under construction at Cappelli's $325 million City Center site in downtown White Plains. The Trump Organization will lead the development, sales and management of the building when it is completed by summer 2005.

“The location and architecture of Trump Tower at City Center is top of the line. Working with Louis Cappelli, a friend of mine for many years, is a great honor. Lou and I understand quality, and that is what we are bringing to Trump Tower at City Center,�? said Trump, president of The Trump Organization and host of the reality TV show “The Apprentice,�? in a statement. “Trump Tower at City Center will not only attract the highest level of Westchester purchasers, but will also attract purchasers looking for an alternative to living in Manhattan.�?

The 35-story tower will boast 212 luxury condominium residences when it opens in summer 2005. Manhattan architect Costas Kondylis, the designer of many of Trump's residential towers in Manhattan, is designing Trump Tower at City Center.

“This is a very exciting moment, not only for City Center, but for White Plains and Westchester County,�? said Cappelli. “Donald J. Trump is without question the best known name in ultra-luxury residential real estate today.�?
