Former GOP Speechwriter Accuses Obama of ‘Plagiarizing’ Bush in SOTU
Appearing on Fox News Channel with anchor Megyn Kelly after President Barack Obama delivered his fifth State of the Union address on Tuesday night, former George W. Bush speechwriter Marc Thiessen said the president’s speech sounded uncannily similar to him.

“Did the president crib off of George W. Bush?” Kelly asked.

“It was eerily familiar,” Thiessen replied.

”There were lines like ‘Our job is to help Americans build a future of hope and opportunity, a future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy, a future of hope and opportunity requires that all citizens have affordable and available healthcare, extending opportunity and hope depends on a stable supply of energy,’ all of that came from the 2007 State of the Union from George W. Bush.”

“Barack Obama has gone from blaming George W. Bush to plagiarizing George W. Bush,” he added.

POLITICO’s Dylan Byers notes that “no lines were directly lifted from Bush’s 2007 speech in the one Obama gave on Tuesday.” However, there were thematic similarities between the two speeches, including the frequent use of the word “opportunity.”
