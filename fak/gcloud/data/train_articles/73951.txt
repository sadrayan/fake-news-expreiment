Zika virus might damage vision
Story highlights Zika may threaten vision in babies born to mothers infected with virus

Scarring is similar to what is seen with other viral infections in eyes

Experts worry damage could occur even in babies without microcephaly

(CNN) Zika may now be linked to serious eye abnormalities that could lead to blindness in Brazilian newborns with microcephaly, according to a study published in JAMA.

"These are severe retina lesions that will impede the ability of the children to see well," said lead author Rubens Belfort Jr., head professor of ophthalmology at the Federal University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. "Many of these children could be blind."

Microcephaly is a birth defect defined by an abnormally small head. Depending on the severity of the disorder and the part of the brain affected, babies who live with the defect often have developmental issues, as well as hearing and vision problems. However, experts say that does not explain the findings from Brazil.

"Over 35% of the babies tested showed signs of scarring from an active viral infection in the eye. That's much different from what would be associated with poor eye development in a microcephaly brain," said ophthalmologist Lee M. Jampol, of Northwestern University, who wrote a corresponding commentary for JAMA. "It's much more similar to what we've seen in the past with Ebola and West Nile virus."

"It provides evidence that the effects of Zika are not limited to the brain," said Yale Professor of Epidemiology and Medicine Dr. Albert Ko, who is also co-author on the study.
