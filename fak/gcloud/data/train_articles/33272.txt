The celebration of Eid al-Fitr marks the conclusion of the Muslim month of Ramadan, a 30-day period that requires those practicing to abstain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset.

For 1.8 billion Muslims, Eid al-Fitr is one of the most festive periods in the religion's calendar. Eid is often commemorated with large feasts and family time, as well as charitable acts and donations.
