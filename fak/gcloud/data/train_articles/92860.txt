What Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush are up the week of Nov. 16

Rubio is in Washington Monday for the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council. Trivia: this is the event where a year ago Bush made his "lose the primary to win the general comment." Then Rubio goes on a three-day fundraising tour that will take him to New York, Texas, California and Arizona. On Friday he begins a multi-day swing through Iowa.

Bush is in South Carolina on Tuesday for the Leadership Columbia luncheon, a meet and greet at Wholly Smokinâ€™ BBQ in Florence, and a town hall in Myrtle Beach. Wednesday he gives a speech at The Citadel that will certainly touch on ISIS. On Thursday Bush returns to New Hampshire with an event in Manchester and a town hall in Londonderry. Friday he's fundraising in New York.
