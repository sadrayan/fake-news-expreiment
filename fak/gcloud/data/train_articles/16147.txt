This is from Christopher Stelly, Executive Director of Louisiana Entertainment (http://www.opportunitylouisiana.com/page/entertainment):

"Since 2002, Louisiana has established itself as one of the premier motion picture production destinations in the world. We have built a recognized brand that includes a very deep, skilled workforce, mature infrastructure and diverse locations. Additionally, the state has been very successful at establishing one of the most reliable and stable tax incentive programs. In 2013, our state was recognized by a third part as having more feature film production than any other state in the nation (California included).

The project mentioned below, Don't Mess With Texas, was filmed primarily in Louisiana. According to their application, they anticipated spending about $34 million in the state; however, as of today, we have not received an audit to validate their actual spending & no credits have been issued by my office. We will get you a contact name and number for this production as well."

According to our film office, the production had a working title of “Busted.” The contact per the application was Brian Bruskrud, 310.449.3875.

Hope this is useful. Apologies for the delay.

— Ron
