Alert: Critical Help Needed On Appointment of Florida Supreme Court Judges



DATE: August 20, 2008

TO: USF & NRA Member and Friends

FROM: Marion P. Hammer

USF Executive Director

NRA Past President



Very soon, Governor Charlie Crist will appoint two new members to the Florida Supreme Court to fill the vacancies created by the resignations of Justice Raoul Cantero and Justice Kenneth Bell.



These appointments are critical to Florida gun owners.







We need judges who respect all our freedoms, especially our Second Amendment freedoms. We need judges who will strictly uphold the Constitution, and not legislate from the bench.



Therefore, we need to let Governor Crist know that we SUPPORT:





Judge Charles Canady for the At-Large Seat Vacancy on the Florida Supreme Court,



and





Judge Ricky L. Polston for the First DCA Vacancy on the Florida Supreme Court.





Please email Governor Crist IMMEDIATELY and urge him to appoint Judge Charles Canady and Judge Ricky Polston to the Florida Supreme Court.



Send your email to the Governor at this address:

Absolutely! As we saw from the Heller vs. DC, it sure matters who sits in these courts (US as well as the States Supreme Courts).

camacho Update:



Gov. Charlie Crist on Wednesday named Judge Ricky Polston to the Florida Supreme Court. Polston replaces Justice Kenneth B. Bell, who stepped down to return to private practice in Pensacola.



Polston, 52, is Crists second appointment to the high court.



Justice Raoul Cantero also stepped down earlier this year to return to private practice. He was replaced by Charles T. Canady, who joined the bench last month.



Polston has served on the 1st District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee since 2001. He is a Panhandle native who graduated from Florida State University College of Law, where he also has taught as an adjunct professor.

I am sure that all of us who wrote the governor have small but invaluable contribution towards achieving the goal of putting in the Florida Supreme Court judges who would not engage in social engineering but rather strictly interpret the rule of law.

mallc is, in the strictest sense, "social engineering". An attempt to organize and place structure in civilization.



You really don't mean the "rule of law". You mean interpret the law as you believe it should be interpreted. Otherwise we'd still have a handgun ban in DC and you would agree with it.

camacho You mean interpret the law as you believe it should be interpreted.



It's not what I believe but what the Founding Fathers believed!

pilot teacher I believe Gov. Charlie Crist did appoint Polston to the Florida Supreme Court.:)



There was a tiny,tiny article in the St. Petersburg Times, a far left fringe lunatic newspaper.
