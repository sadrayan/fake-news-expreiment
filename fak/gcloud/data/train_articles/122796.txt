Quirky Hamptons Paper, Reading for Rich, Is Sold
The distinctive size 7 ¼ Panama hat is, and is not, included in the deal.

Dan’s Papers — a free weekly newspaper whose quirky coverage of the Hamptons is required reading for the rich, the famous and those who wish they were — has been sold to a company that owns more than 80 newspapers, mainly in Ohio.

The price was between $19 million and $20 million, according to someone with knowledge of the deal but who did not want to be named because the sale had not yet closed. Dan’s Papers had been controlled by News Communications, which owns other subsidiaries that publish Who’s Who in America and The Hill, a Washington paper published four days a week that covers Congress and national politics.

The buyer, the Brown Publishing Company, is a family-owned company based in Cincinnati with 18 daily newspapers and 62 weeklies — some sold, some free.

Dan Rattiner, the founder, president, publisher and editor in chief of Dan’s Papers, will stay on for “as long as he wants to keep putting out the great stuff he puts out,” said Roy Brown, the president and chief executive of Brown Publishing.

The deal, which was first reported by Newsday, also includes a magazine, Hampton Style; a Web site, danshamptons.com; and a second paper, The Montauk Pioneer. James A. Finkelstein, chief executive of News Communications, said Dan’s Papers had a circulation of 60,000 copies a week in the summer and 40,000 during the rest of the year.
