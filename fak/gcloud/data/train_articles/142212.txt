Germany is brainwashing children to become Muslim since more than a decade
Germany is brainwashing children to become Muslim for more than a decade

Last week we told about a German children’s program that was encouraging a relationship between a young German girl and a Muslim migrant of at least 25-years-old.

But looking back at history the brainwashing started much earlier. According to our German source, this was a 2006 series about a woman who became Muslim and told her son that every child is a Muslim. Decide for yourself what you see and how this will influence the viewpoints of children:

In another video the recent knife murder of a young German girl by an Afghan migrant is downplayed as a romantic drama. It is another form of propaganda that ignores dangerous honour crimes within Muslim communities. Instead it focuses on the “dangers” of right-wing viewpoints and demonstrations.
