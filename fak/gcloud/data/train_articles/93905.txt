BREAKING: Malia Obama Just Got Arrested Buying Cocaine
When Barack Obama released over 350 drug dealers as his term was ending, did he know his oldest daughter had a drug problem? Malia has been caught on camera smoking marijuana at concerts, drinking to the point that she was rolling around on the floor, and has been involved in multiple drug incidents at Harvard. Now, apparently, she has followed in her father’s footsteps and graduated to cocaine.

According to Cambridge New Press, Malia was arrested by an undercover officer while buying cocaine at the home of a known drug dealer in Cambridge, Massachusetts:

The daughter of former President Barack Obama was briefly behind bars after she was caught purchasing 19 hectograms of cocaine — an amount bearing the street value of $1,240.97.

Obama was approached by the officer after leaving the home of drug dealer Christopher Turk, a notorious area drug dealer.

When the officer searched her oversized Prada handbag, he found the cocaine as well as a marijuana bong and rolling papers.

Obama was taken to prison and faces nine counts of possession of an illegal substance. Her father bailed her out hours later.

Obama’s court date is set for September 31 where she is expected to enter a guilty plea in exchange for leniency.

Police also arrested Turk on multiple counts of drug proliferation.

The Obama family is complete trash and this proves it! It’s anyone’s guess if she will actually be punished for this or if her father will get the charges dropped. If there is any justice in the world at all, she will find herself behind bars.
