8 die of ‘flu’ in 2 weeks in Santa Barbara. 7 had their flu shot
The sickest people I have seen around here were the ones who HAD the flu shot. Last night I was out with a big group of my "healthy" friends, and NOT ONE OF THEM HAD GOTTEN THE FLU SHOT. Four friends couldn't join us, and I know for a fact three of them had the flu shot (probably the other one did too, as she is a rabid pro-vaxxer with her kids which have all needed therapy in order to learn to talk and have weird facial tics and have ADHD and struggle socially and intellectually at school)

During the course of the conversation, the HEALTHY friends all said that they don't believe in the flu shot any more. At least HALF had gotten the flu shot years ago and gotten very sick from it, and quit getting it (Me too-sickest I've ever been was after the flu shot 4 years ago) One guy said 2 of his co-workers bragged they got the shot to him days before they got terribly sick and have been out for 2 weeks so far (he has to do all of their work as well as his own).

I like to think I am a critical thinker-and when our friends who got flu shots are all too sick to join us and the ones who stay far away from it have NOT HAD ANY ILLNESS WHATSOEVER-doesn't that make an intelligent person start thinking?
