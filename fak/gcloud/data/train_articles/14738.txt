REP. ANN WAGNER REMAINS SILENT MORE THAN ONE WEEK AFTER CORT VANOSTRAN ISSUES DEBATE CHALLENGE IN RACE FOR MISSOURI’S SECOND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – Aug. 21, 2018

Webster Groves, MO. – On Aug. 13, Cort VanOstran, Democratic candidate for Missouri’s Second Congressional District, challenged incumbent Rep. Ann Wagner to a public debate in order to allow voters to ask each candidate about their vision for the district. Despite a call to her campaign office and the public challenge, Rep. Ann Wagner has yet to respond.

“Our leadership should first and foremost be accountable to the people of this district,” said VanOstran. “I believe that voters deserve to be represented by someone who will answer the tough questions and explain the policies they stand behind. While Rep. Wagner refuses to show up, I’m ready to listen to the people of this district and tell them where I stand. Today, I’m challenging Rep. Wagner to show up — this time for a debate.”

Rep. Ann Wagner, a three-term incumbent, has never held a town hall in the Second District and remains unavailable to the people she represents. In October 2016, Rep. Ann Wagner failed to show up for a debate hosted by the League of Women Voters.

VanOstran has left the debate’s location and time open for Rep. Ann Wagner to accommodate her corporate fundraising schedule.
