As defund debate hits, Live Action exposes Planned Parenthood’s prenatal care deception
First video of new undercover investigation reveals Planned Parenthood doesn’t help women who want to keep their babies

Washington, D.C. (January 24, 2017) – Today, Live Action released a new investigative video debunking Planned Parenthood’s claim that it provides critical prenatal care to pregnant women. The abortion giant has insisted that prenatal care is one of its core services that women will lose if its taxpayer funding is cut off. But Live Action’s investigation proves those services are virtually nonexistent at the abortion chain.

“The Prenatal Care Deception” is the first in Live Action’s “Abortion Corporation” series of investigative videos highlighting Planned Parenthood’s own employees saying its focus is providing abortions, not women’s health care. Live Action is releasing the investigative series as Congress plans to redirect Medicaid dollars away from Planned Parenthood to local health clinics and also vote on the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.

(Live Action contacted all 41 Planned Parenthood affiliates where undercover recording is permitted by state law.)

Although Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told the media in 2011 that “Prenatal care – these are the kinds of services that folks depend on Planned Parenthood for,” Live Action investigators searching for such services at Planned Parenthood were turned away by 92 of the 97 centers they contacted. They received responses like:

“Planned Parenthood offers abortions, so they don’t offer prenatal care.”

– Tempe, AZ, Planned Parenthood

“No, we don’t do prenatal services. I mean, it’s called Planned Parenthood, I know it’s kind of deceiving.”

– Merrillville, IN, Planned Parenthood

“No, see, we don’t see pregnant women as a way of giving prenatal care, we see pregnant women, um, you know, if they are considering other options.”

– Santa Fe, NM, Planned Parenthood

“Planned Parenthood says it’s a champion of women’s health care, yet prenatal care, which is an essential service for expectant mothers, is virtually nonexistent,” said Lila Rose, president and founder of Live Action. “Our investigators who wanted to keep their babies were turned away by 92 out of 97 Planned Parenthood centers. It’s clear that despite its claims, abortion is the priority and the only option for pregnant women that visit Planned Parenthood.”

Live Action is investing $500,000 in a digital ad campaign to push the video series out to millions of Americans. Future videos will further expose Planned Parenthood’s lack of health care services and include the testimonies of former Planned Parenthood managers.

“The upcoming �?Abortion Corporation’ investigative videos, combined with our recent video that debunked Planned Parenthood’s claim that only three percent of its services are abortions, are a powerful argument to defund Planned Parenthood of its half a billion dollars in taxpayer funding,” said Rose.

Live Action’s previously released “3%” video uses Planned Parenthood’s own numbers to prove it doesn’t perform a single mammogram, and it performs less than two percent of all women’s cancer screenings in the United States, yet it commits over 30 percent of America’s abortions: 887 abortions a day and over 320,000 abortions last year alone. Planned Parenthood is so focused on abortion that it aborts 160 children for every one child it refers out for adoption.

A challenge from Lila Rose

“I anticipate Planned Parenthood will respond as it usually does by denying the overwhelming findings of this investigation,” said Rose. “That’s why I encourage media outlets to contact any of the 97 centers that Live Action did – or any others – and ask them if they offer prenatal care, how long they’ve been doing so, and then ask for proof. The media will find results similar to ours: Planned Parenthood’s prenatal care claim is bogus.

“We know from past experience that Planned Parenthood is untrustworthy and lies repeatedly to the public, as it did during Live Action’s 2011 child sex trafficking exposé. Last week, Live Action released public records that show Planned Parenthood failed to report child sex traffickers to local authorities as it had claimed. Planned Parenthood also lied about retraining thousands of its staff to identify and report sex traffickers. Instead, a former manager says the sessions were used to train staff how to identify undercover journalists. You can read the article and see the evidence here.”
