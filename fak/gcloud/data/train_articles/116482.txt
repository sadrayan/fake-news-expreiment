Washington (CNN) Can you smell what The Rock is cooking -- on Pennsylvania Avenue?

Wrestling star and actor Dwyane Johnson entertained a possible political career Friday, tweeting out interest in making a bid for president.

"Cool piece on why I should run for President. Maybe one day. Surely the White House has a spot for my pick up truck," Johnson tweeted, linking to a story that laid out why he should occupy the White House.

The story , from the conservative Independent Journal, uses Instagram photos from Johnson's personal account to jokingly lay out his campaign advantages, featuring him doing everything from pumping iron to volunteering.

Johnson is a Republican and has also engaged in some political comedy, reprising his "Saturday Night Live" character "The Rock Obama" last year. In the sketch, Johnson portrays the angry version of President Barack Obama, punishing the famously even-keel President's opponents.
