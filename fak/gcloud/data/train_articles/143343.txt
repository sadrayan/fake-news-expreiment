A very readable and exciting investigation of the Bermuda Triangle Legend that will especially please readers who think scientifically. The author compares each legendary disappearance of a craft with the original sources of information and the results of official investigations. He proves that many, if not most, of the disappearances occurred OUTSIDE the Bermuda Triangle. He shows that prosaic explanations have been established for most of the disappearances. Further, he shows that for some of the alleged disappearances there is no evidence that the craft ever existed and in other cases the craft were found in perfect condition with crews intact. Perhaps quoting the author's concluding remarks (page 277) is the best summation: "Many of the writers who publicized the events did no original research but merely rephrased the articles of previous writers, thereby perpetuating the errors and embellishments in earlier accounts. In a number of incidents writers withheld information that provided an obvious solution to the disappearance. The Legend of the Bermuda Triangle is a manufactured mystery. It began because of careless research and was elaborated upon and perpetuated by writers who either purposely or unknowingly made use of misconceptions, faulty reasoning, and sensationalism. It was repeated so many times that it began to take on the aura of truth."
