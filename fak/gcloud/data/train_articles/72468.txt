Cars from the "Axis of Evil": North Korea
Thanks to the glory of communism, North Korea has what might be one of the lowest rates of car ownership in the world. Although the government doesn’t release official stats, the best estimate is that there are fewer than 30,000 vehicles on the road—in a country of nearly 24 million people. (Officially, private citizens can’t own cars, but those with government ties manage to.) You are more likely to know somebody with a private jet than a North Korean is to know somebody with a car. But that doesn’t mean the country’s few cars are boring. In addition to the standard-issue black S-class, North Korea has some of the wackiest cars on the planet.
