History of the Bar
Discipline over the Bar

Discipline over the Bar has, since the reign of Edward I, been the responsibility of judges. In practice, this has been carried out by the benchers of the Inns, subject to the visitorial jurisdiction of the judges. The General Council of the Bar (Bar Council) was formed in 1894 to deal with matters of professional etiquette. In 1974, the Bar Council and the governing body of the Inns, the Senate, combined to form the Senate of the Inns of Court and the Bar. On 1 January 1987, in line with the recommendations of a report on the Constitution of the Senate by Lord Rawlinson PC QC, a Council of the Inns of Court was re-established, and the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 designated the Bar Council as the authorised body for the profession.
