Lawyers for Good Government
The 2016 election served as an historic and much needed wake-up call for millions of Americans who care deeply about democracy and justice.

Democratic institutions, rights, and values are clearly and explicitly under attack; not just at the federal level, but in state and local governments across the country. Conflicts of interest, corruption, gerrymandering, voter suppression, threats to freedom of the press, discriminatory policies - the list goes on. We now wake up wondering what new crisis our government will create for the American people each day.

In the wake of the 2016 election, more than 125,000 lawyers and concerned citizens joined together to resist these threats through two new organizations: Lawyers for Good Government (L4GG) and the Lawyers for Good Government Foundation (L4GG Foundation).

Unlike other organizations, L4GG and the L4GG Foundation harness the volunteer energies and talents of tens of thousands of lawyers distributed throughout the country who are ready, willing, and able to coordinate and mobilize quickly in defense of democratic institutions, individuals at risk, and “good government” principles.
