Avalere Health : Analysis on Health Plan Offerings on the Federally-Facilitated Marketplace
The file, along with Avalere’s own analysis, shows robust insurer participation, with the vast majority of states having four or more insurers offering plans in the individual market in the new health insurance marketplaces.

“The federally-facilitated marketplace landscape reveals meaningful competition among insurers and a variety of plan options for consumers to choose among,” said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health. “Consumers in many states will find options from Blues plans and national carriers competing alongside local, regional, and provider-sponsored insurers.”





Additionally, Avalere examined the premiums of health plan offerings in the individual market in the top 13 federally-facilitated marketplace states (by expected exchange enrollment)*. Looking at plan offerings in the largest city in each of these 13 states, Avalere found that the second lowest cost Silver plan is:

A Blues plan in eight of the 13 states





A national plan (Humana or Coventry) in two of the 13 states





A local or regional plan in two of the 13 states





A Medicaid/Medicare Advantage plan in one of the 13 states











Methodology:

Avalere Health analyzed the QHP individual medical landscape dataset released by HHS and available here. For states not included in this dataset, the map of carrier participation reflects Avalere’s own research and tracking. To examine premiums, Avalere selected the top 13 states by expected enrollment included in the HHS file. Avalere looked at Silver plans (not including child-only plans) offered in one zip code in the largest city in each of those states.

*The 13 states include: AR, FL, GA, IL, IN, MI, NC, NJ, OH, PA, TX, VA, and WI.
