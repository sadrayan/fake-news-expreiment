A gutted roof, blackened stone and a gaping hole where the spire once stood.

The scale of the damage caused by a devastating fire that tore through Notre Dame cathedral on Monday has been revealed by dramatic images shot from a drone above the 850-year-old church.

The pictures, taken by Lana Sator, show the interior of the medieval Catholic church exposed to the elements, and the impact caused by the dramatic collapse of the structure's spire.

French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to rebuild the cathedral, one of Paris' most-famous landmarks.
