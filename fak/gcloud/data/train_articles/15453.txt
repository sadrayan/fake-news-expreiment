Got it.

Did O’Reilly mention the Austin figure before the Oct. 7 broadcast? I ask because the latest available report before that show indicates that through September, the number of individuals murdered in Austin was up 44 percent from the comparable chunk of 2014. (The year-to-year difference has varied in 2015, ranging from nothing in January to 83 percent in August to 129 percent in May).

Also, what’s your title?

Thanks again.
