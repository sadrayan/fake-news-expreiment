The Food and Drug Association (FDA) has announced this morning that it has approved pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson’s request to produce and sell tranquilizer dart guns specially developed to put kids to sleep.

The origins of the photo are unknown, but it has been circulating online as a demotivational poster since at least 2010:
