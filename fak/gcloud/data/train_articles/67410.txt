Chelsea Clinton went down in a blaze of glory at the International Seaport in Cheyenne, France today when Interpol agents approached her to place her in custody for extradition to the United States. Clinton, who has been the head of the family foundation for some time now, was furious to find out that her parents openly used the cargo ships and planes that were supposed to be vessels of charity, for worldwide drug smuggling, the black market, human trafficking and even to transport terrorists.

With the arrest and confession of New Jersey Senator Hal Lindsay, tying the ships and foundation to drugs on a billion dollar scale, things have obviously gotten tense for poor Chelsea, whose name was on the ship that was raided in Baltimore that started this whole mess:

She tried to physically remove herself from the scene, saying she was on her way to her plane, but the Clintons don’t fly commercial. A private jet was running on the tarmac waiting for Chelsea with no flight plan filed and no reason to be there. She was obviously trying to flee. She was remanded to custody and handed to the US Marshals, who will make sure she makes whatever appointment is awaiting her back home.

Bill and Hillary still haven’t made a statement or confessed to any wrongdoing. They are currently at the compound in upstate New York. Presumably, if Chelsea is being taken for questioning, there’s a good possibility that her parents will be too.
