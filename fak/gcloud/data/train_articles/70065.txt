Amendment 1 billed as pro-consumer, supported by big money - ABC-7.com WZVN News for Fort Myers, Cape Coral & Naples, Florida
CAPITOL NEWS SERVICE â€” Solar power will be on the ballot in November. Amendment 1 is being billed as "pro-consumer," but it's being backed by big money donors.

Florida's investor-owned utilities have pumped more than $15 million in Amendment 1. They say it protects consumers, but many believe it only promotes solar developed by those companies.

The group "Consumers for Smart Solar" has raised nearly $22 million, most of it from big utility companies. The average contribution is $168,000.

Matt Carter, the group's organizer, is a former utility regulator. He said the goal is to protect consumers.

"Protection from fraud. Protection from substandard equipment. Protections from scams and ripoffs."

Asked how many consumers contributed to his group, Carter said he didn't have that information, "but it's readily available."

The answer is 12, and they've given a total of $405.

While many want to see Florida move ahead with solar, Rick Vaske with Advance Solar in Fort Myers said voting for Amendment 1 is the wrong way to do it.

"This is not actually a move toward solar, it's a move toward power companies controlling the solar industry," Vaske said.

If Amendment 1 passes, consumers would never be allowed to sell excess energy generated by their panels. Solar could also be more heavily regulated, most likely by the Public Service Commission, the same commission regulating utilities.

Sixty percent of Florida voters must approve Amendment 1 for it to pass.
