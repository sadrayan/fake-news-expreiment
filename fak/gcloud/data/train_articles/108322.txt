Famous Redwoods
Hike: 80% of the hike from the parking lot to Hyperion is on a maintained trail. From the trailhead, hike west/downhill 1.4 mi (2.3 km) on Tall Trees Trail to Tall Trees Grove. Turn left at the bench to access Redwood Creek nearest Tom McDonald Creek. Cross Redwood Creek and hike 0.3 mi (0.5 km) up Tom McDonald Creek. Most of the hike up Tom McDonald Creek is clear of brush and very accessible, but expect to get your feet wet. There are three sets of big logs in the creek that you must climb over, or under, which is the only reason this hike is rated moderate instead of easy. About 0.3 mi (0.5 km) up Tom McDonald Creek, 100 ft (30 m) past the last big logs, you will see this pair of tall trees on the hill to your right. Hyperion is the right tree of the pair. Exit the creek here and, following a pair of fallen logs, hike north 215 ft (66 m) uphill to Hyperion. Welcome to the tallest tree on Earth!

Creek Warning: Hyperion is not accessible via Tall Trees Trail when Redwood Creek has high water levels. Though seasonal footbridges are installed throughout summer and fall, the footbridges do no cross Redwood Creek near Tom McDonald Creek. You must wade across Redwood Creek and up Tom McDonald Creek to get to Hyperion. It is best to visit Hyperion from July through October when Redwood Creek is low enough to wade across. To visit Hyperion whenever Redwood Creek is impassable, use the 10.5 mi (16.9 km) longer alternate route via Orick Horse Trail.
