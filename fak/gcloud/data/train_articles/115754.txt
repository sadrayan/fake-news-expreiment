Obama Marks 9/11 With White House Moment of Silence
President and Mrs. Obama stood with heads bowed and then hands on their hearts as chimes rang out and then the mournful sound of taps filled the air. Marking his first 9/11 anniversary as president, Mr. Obama was joined by dozens of staffers including his chief of staff, the chef in his white coat, uniformed secret service guards and many others. A steady rain stopped just as the simple and poignant white house ceremony began. And as the last notes of taps echoed across the lawn, it started pouring again.
