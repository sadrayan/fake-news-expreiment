Omnibus cuts IRS budget, bans funds from being used to target individuals – SCOTUS to hear severance pay case Presented by the International Council of Shopping Centers

OMNIBUS BILL CUTS IRS BUDGET. Congressional appropriators axed the IRS budget for this fiscal year in the omnibus budget bill released last night and also took aim at the agency for its scrutiny of conservative tea party groups. The agency was allocated $11.2 billion — a reduction from its $12 billion budget during the 2013 fiscal year and a significant drop from the figure IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said the agency needs to tackle tax collection, fraud and Obamacare.

Story Continued Below

The Obama administration asked Congress for nearly $13 billion for the IRS. The drop was not unexpected after the agency was harshly criticized by congressional Republicans for targeting conservative tea party groups for extra scrutiny. The omnibus bill explicitly bans the agency from using the funds to “target citizens of the United States for exercising any right guaranteed under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.” Congressional appropriators also took aim at the agency department faulted for the two-year target by mandating that at least $200,000 should be earmarked for “intensive training of employees in the Exempt Organizations Unit.”

NO MORE SPOCK. The bill also prohibits the funds from being used to produce any videos unless approved by a “Service-Wide Video Editorial Board.” The agency was slammed in 2013 for spending $60,000 to create a poorly-produced training video spoofing Star Trek.

MORE MONEY FOR INSPECTOR GEORGE. But Congress did not skimp on money for the government watchdog that unveiled the depth of the target party targeting — even going above the White House’s budget request. The White House asked that the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration be given $150,538,000 during the 2014 fiscal year and the omnibus language increases that funding to $156,375,000.

THE OMNIBUS BILL overall is a $1.1 trillion spending that “fills in the blanks of the December budget agreement and promises to restore some order to government funding over the next year. Under pressure from Republicans, the measure keeps a tight rein on new funding for Wall Street regulators and effectively freezes appropriations for President Barack Obama’s health care program at the reduced, post-sequester level. But the White House retains the flexibility to find the financing it needs to implement the health exchanges and appears satisfied to have avoided the most contentious restrictions proposed by conservatives,” my colleague David Rogers reports.

ISSA: FBI SUGGESTION OF NO CRIMINAL CHARGES “UNDERMINE[S]” INVESTIGATION. The FBI is unlikely suggest that criminal charges be levied against any officials at the IRS over the tea party targeting controversy, officials close to the probe told the Wall Street Journal. If true, a lack of criminal penalties would serve as a confirmation that no agency official leaked or shared private taxpayer information or broke the law when targeting the tea party groups. A DOJ spokesman had no comment on the report and a law enforcement official stressed to POLITICO that the investigation is “ongoing.”

The report was met with frustration from House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and fellow committee Republican Jim Jordan. “Anonymous — and apparently politically motivated — leaks from unnamed law enforcement officials further undermine the public assurances by the current and former FBI directors that this is a legitimate investigation. These leaks come after the Justice Department, citing the confidential nature of the investigation, refused to brief Congress on its progress and congressional investigators independently discovered that a high dollar contributor to the Obama Administration failed to recuse herself,” the pair said in a statement.

SCOTUS TO HEAR SEVERANCE PAY CASE. Oral arguments begin today in a case that could determine how lump-sum severance pay is taxed when a company shuts down, with implications for the government into the $1 billion-range. The case, United States v. Quality Stores Inc., involves a dispute over how federal statutes define what income falls under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax withholding. Quality Stores, which shut down in 2001, withheld FICA taxes for their employees in their severance pay. The company still argues the withholding was unnecessary as a portion of the tax code says "supplemental unemployment benefits" are exempt from the tax. But that conflicts with a separate aspect of the code that says “all remuneration for employment” should face the FICA taxes. It’s a gray code, Marianna Dyson of Miller & Chevalier told Morning Tax. “The straightforwardness of the statutory argument and the fact that the IRS has frankly been rather schizophrenic in its issue of these tax rulings…will help the taxpayer,” she said.

HAPPY TUESDAY! Morning Tax is cheering on her GW Colonials in their game against VCU tonight with hopes that we can make it to Brooklyn and beyond. Let’s talk taxes. You can find me at lfrench@politico.com or @ LaurenNFrench. As always, please follow @ POLITICOPro and @ Morning_Tax.

HOUSE: In at noon with votes at 1:30 p.m.

SENATE: Convenes at 10 a.m.

JUDGE SIDES WITH WHITE HOUSE IN OFFSHORE TAX EVASION CASE. Reuters’ Patrick Temple-West has the story, “In a win for the Obama administration's fight against offshore tax evasion, a U.S. federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit challenging new rules forcing U.S. banks to tell the Internal Revenue Service about certain accounts held by foreigners. Set to take effect in March, the rules are part of a fast-emerging global web of bank information-sharing agreements between the United States and many other countries meant to combat the hiding of assets abroad to avoid paying taxes.” http://reut.rs/1hREpEI

OBAMACARE NOT A DEBT CEILING WEAPON THIS TIME. Seung Min Kim reports, “Hill Republicans are starting to whip up their wish lists for the debt limit battle later this year. Missing from many of those lists: Obamacare. The debt limit will have to be hiked sometime between late February and early June, depending on various government estimates. But congressional Republicans from across the ideological spectrum are already skeptical of trying to extract concessions from Democrats on the Affordable Care Act — a dynamic that triggered an unpopular government shutdown last fall.” http://politi.co/1eBtERH

SWISS TACK ON WHISTLEBLOWERS COULD CHILL U.S. TAX EVASION EFFORTS. Rachael Bade reports, “Switzerland is taking a new tack to protect its prized banking secrecy — one that could undermine the race by U.S. tax authorities to snag tax evaders stashing funds offshore. The country, which bars citizens from dishing banking secrets to foreign governments, is probing former Swiss banker Renzo Gadola for spilling the beans on rich Americans with hidden bank accounts, according to the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland…The Swiss contend they’re merely upholding their privacy laws, but some say the investigation sends a message to bankers: Keep quiet or else.” http://politico.pro/1iJFFaC

WHAT PROS ARE READING: NO HOPE FOR EXTENDERS. Brian Faler writes, “Those wondering about the fate of some 55 just-expired tax breaks known as extenders might want to settle in. Congress is unlikely to renew them anytime soon, and some observers predict this will be the toughest year yet to revive them. Many may never be renewed, said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at the Potomac Research Group…But as their leaders’ agenda suggests, House Republicans have no plans to take them up anytime soon. Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp has not given up on tax reform, and renewing the provisions now would amount to waiving the white flag.” http://politico.pro/1hSGW1p

FIRST LOOK — ASSOCIATION OF NATIONAL ADVERTISERS TO CONGRESS: DON’T TAX THESE ADS. The Association of National Advertisers is out with a study today focusing on the negative consequences they predict if Congress moves forward with proposal to restrict the deduction available for advertising expenses. Designed to boost support for the advertising industry, the study is also an attempt to push back against congressional proposals from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus that would reduce the deduction allowed for advertising expenses to 50 percent and spread out the deduction period to five years instead of the traditional one-year period. The study found that reducing the tax deduction from 100 percent to 50 percent could create a $456 billion loss in sales and at least 1.7 million jobs lost. View it here: http://bit.ly/L4xxGm. The group official releases their research at 10 a.m. today during a conference call at 1-877-941-9205.

ON THE MOVE: Steptoe & Johnson LLP has announced that Phil West will assume control of the international law-focused firm as chair of Steptoe’s executive committee. West, formerly the head of the firm’s tax group, has been with Steptoe since 1993. He was previously served as international tax counsel at the Treasury Department.
