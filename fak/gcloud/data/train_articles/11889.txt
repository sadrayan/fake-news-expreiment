Jamie Radtke for Senate -- Supporting our Constitution
After dodging the answer for four days, George Allen has taken a “reluctant” stand and says he would reluctantly vote yes on the $38 billion compromise that cuts 1% of the budget. Reluctant yes votes are the story of George Allen’s Senate career.

He reluctantly voted yes to add $3 trillion to the debt, he reluctantly voted yes on the federal takeover of education called No Child Left Behind, he reluctantly voted yes to increase the debt ceiling four times, he reluctantly went along with the rest of the DC Establishment as the federal debt went up $16,000 every SECOND he was in office. We need a new generation of conservative and courageous leadership in Virginia, not “reluctant yes” votes that are bad for Virginia.

The federal government now has a $14 trillion debt — an amount nearly equal to our entire gross domestic product — thanks to the “reluctant yes” votes of career, establishment politicians like George Allen.
