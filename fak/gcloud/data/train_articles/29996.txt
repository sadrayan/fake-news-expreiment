Brown Supports Commonsense, Bipartisan Immigration Compromise Senator Supported Two Proposals to Provide Certainty to Dreamers, Boost Border Security

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) today supported two separate commonsense, bipartisan immigration proposals, to boost border security and provide certainty to young people brought to this country as children, known as Dreamers. Both were supported by Democrats and Republicans, but failed to gain the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate. Brown called on Congress to continue working on a solution to fix the broken immigration system and support Dreamers.

“I stood with Democrats and Republicans today to support two plans that would have provided certainty for Dreamers and boosted border security. I’m disappointed these bipartisan compromises didn’t pass, and I’ll continue working for a commonsense solution to fix our broken immigration system,” said Brown. “The President promised to deport violent criminals, not innocent young people who are working, going to school, paying taxes and contributing to their communities. Dreamers were brought here as children, through no fault of their own, and they are American in every sense but the paperwork.”

Brown voted today for two bipartisan amendments, one put forward by Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware and the other by Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine. Both compromises would have boosted border security and provided a path for Dreamers to become citizens.

In 2013, Brown supported the bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate. That bill would have significantly boosted border security and provided a pathway for those who obey the law, pay taxes and work to earn citizenship.
