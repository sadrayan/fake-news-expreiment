Federal cuts will affect Northeast Ohio if budget stalemate continues
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Whether by meat cleaver or surgical scalpel, cuts to federal spending are scheduled to begin at the end of the week, soon affecting thousands of Northeast Ohioans.

Children in Head Start could lose teachers, while students who would normally qualify for speech or physical therapy might have to wait, say the White House, congressional Democrats and allied interest groups. Workers at factories and food plants, to say nothing of consumers, could see fewer safety and health inspectors. There will be more time to remove shoes and take out laptops at airports, because security lines are expected to grow.

And while benefits such as Social Security and Medicaid would be safe, seniors and people with disabilities might need be more patient when trying to get a customer service representative on the phone -- because representatives will be furloughed, although their time off is likely to be staggered rather than all at once.

It has come to this, four days before the dreaded "sequester" -- a fancy word for automatic, across-the-board spending cuts to discretionary government programs, including defense. Congress and President Barack Obama, on the precipice of crisis yet again, cannot agree on what to do.

Congress members in adjacent Ohio districts cannot even agree, either.

Jim Jordan and Marcy Kaptur are a good example, as they are neighbors in a geographic sense but worlds apart on what to do and whether to fend off the automatic spending cuts that will occur on March 1 without a deal.

Champaign County's Jordan, who chaired the conservative Republican Study Committee for the past two years, says the automatic cuts are needed to keep the government from sinking under crushing levels of debt.

"We need to take this first step and let the country see that it's not the end of the world," says Jordan, who expressed hope they'll spur more efforts to address the budget deficit.

Toledo Democrat Kaptur, who serves on the committee that writes the federal budget, says the cuts will slow economic growth by boosting unemployment and creating uncertainty over pending government contracts

"This is government by stunt," Kaptur says. "Those that couldn't win the presidency at the ballot box are now trying to use some of the arcane procedures of Congress to stop progress. It is so unnecessary."

If Congress fails to act this week, approximately $85 billion will be cut from the federal budget by September, split evenly between defense and non-defense programs. Some programs will remain untouched, such as benefits administered by the Social Security and Veterans Administrations, Medicaid, food stamps, and federal highway money for states. This year's cuts would be the first of $1 trillion in spending reductions over the next ten years.

The spending reductions were set up by the Budget Control Act of 2011. When Democrats and Republicans could not initially agree on specific cuts, they established a "supercommittee" charged with finding further savings. To encourage a deal by the supercommittee, the bill set up automatic spending cuts that would start this January if Congress didn't replace them with something more palatable, such as some combination of taxes or fee hikes and lesser cuts. But no compromise was reached.

A deal on New Year's Eve postponed the cuts, however, until March 1, and stopped automatic tax increases that were to have begun. It also reduced the size of this year's spending reductions by about $24 billion, although that was largely a trick of the calendar.

Time has nearly run out, once again. The cuts could have far-reaching effects if they're made, Democrats say, although conservatives say that with a $3.6 trillion budget, the loss of $85 billion this year might not be nearly as devastating as claimed -- especially if estimates are correct that nearly half that sum could be carried over to future years, with $44 billion in 2013 cuts.

But Warrensville Heights Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge -- who refers to the cuts as "March Madness" -- predicts they'll cost 700,000 jobs around the nation, which could slow down the economy enough to cause a recession.

Fudge also dislikes their impact on social welfare programs. Statistics forwarded by her office indicated that 18,000 mothers and children in Ohio would lose nutritional assistance from the federal Women, Infants and Children program, and 4,755 low-income families in Ohio would lose rental housing vouchers. She says that almost 500 children in her district would not be able to participate in the Head Start program.

Freshman Republican Rep. Dave Joyce of Russell Township says he wants to reduce government spending but thinks the automatic cuts aren't focused enough on wasteful programs.

"I am not a fan of the meat ax approach," Joyce says. "I think you should take a scalpel to all areas of the budget and come up with savings that the hardworking taxpayers of Northeast Ohio deserve."

Ohio Office of Budget and Management Director Tim Keen doesn't think the cuts will significantly disrupt state operations, since they won't affect two of the largest sources of federal funding in Ohio's budget -- Medicaid and most transportation programs. He says his agency is "prepared to work with all state agencies to manage any other impacts the sequestration might create."

Ohio members of Congress interviewed last week were not optimistic that a deal would be crafted in time to delay the March 1 cuts or end the brinksmanship.

U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican who served on the supercommittee that failed to reach a spending agreement, says it's time to stop spending so heavily. But he is working with colleagues in hopes of giving Obama discretion to pick priorities -- and possibly spare some military programs, although cuts to other areas might therefore be bigger to keep the total size of the sequester the same. Portman says that if the cuts are across the board, they could "have a detrimental effect on our national defense and the federal government's vital operations."

"Out-of-control mandatory spending, not a lack of revenue, is driving our nation's long-term deficits, and more tax increases on top of those already implemented this year will only place an additional burden on American families and businesses struggling through a slow economy," said an emailed statement from Portman.

Each side blames the other for the predicament. Holmes County Republican Rep. Bob Gibbs says the Senate and Obama haven't put forth details of cuts "to reduce our nation's outrageous spending habits." He notes that Republicans passed two separate bills that would substitute other cuts, but "the Democrat-controlled Senate did not bring either piece of legislation to the floor."

"If the President is looking for a way to avoid the sequester, he need look no further than our plan because it is the only proposal that has passed in either chamber of Congress," agrees Wadsworth GOP Rep. Jim Renacci.

But Obama says GOP bills would only double down on "harsh, harmful cuts" that affect emergency services, seniors and middle-class families and "ask nothing of the wealthiest Americans or the biggest corporations."

"Now Republicans in Congress face a simple choice: Are they willing to compromise to protect vital investments in education and health care and national security and all the jobs that depend on them?" Obama asked in a Feb. 19 speech. "Or would they rather put hundreds of thousands of jobs and and our entire economy at risk just to protect a few special interest tax loopholes that benefit only the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations? That's the choice."

If the automatic spending cuts are allowed to kick in this week, here are some of the ways they would affect Ohio:

• Air Travel -- All Federal Aviation Administration employees would be furloughed for 11 days. Even though unpaid days off would be staggered among employees, this would hamper air travel around the country by reducing the number of air traffic controllers and technicians on duty. The FAA says it may eliminate overnight shifts at its control towers in Youngstown, Toledo, Dayton and Akron-Canton. Cuts at the Department of Homeland Security also would affect aviation, maritime and border security and increase wait times at land ports of entry and airports. Many in DHS's frontline law enforcement, like Border Patrol agents and customs officials, would face furloughs of up to 14 days. Furloughs of Transportation Security Administration screeners may increase wait times at the nation's busiest airport security checkpoints.

• Coast Guard -- According to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, the Coast Guard would have to defer ongoing maintenance and training, and also curtail air and surface operations by more than 25 percent, harming maritime safety and security,. She says drug interdiction, migrant interdiction, port security and other law enforcement operations will suffer.

• Defense Department -- While active duty military pay won't be touched, pay for civilian Defense Department employees would decrease by about 20 percent between late April and September if proposed furloughs are enacted, says Defense Undersecretary Jessica Lynn Wright. If the cuts go through, 2,300 workers at Cleveland's Defense Finance and Accounting Service center would be subject to furloughs of up to 22 discontinuous work days starting in late April, says DFAS spokesman Tom LaRock. Kaptur says that around 13,000 workers would be subject to furloughs in the Dayton area, where Wright-Patterson Air Force base is a big employer. Key worker benefits, like life insurance, health care and retirement, will generally continue. Across the Defense Department, 46,000 temporary and term employees would be laid off and most civilian hiring would be frozen. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said the furloughs for civilian defense workers would elevate the workload for employees "beyond what can reasonably be achieved," and would "do real harm to our national security." Existing defense contracts are unlikely to be canceled, but new contracts are likely to be delayed.

• Education -- According to figures put out by the White House on Sunday, Ohio primary and secondary schools could lose $25.1 million this year, jeopardizing about 350 teachers and aides. The cuts would hit schools that serve a high number of low-income families especially hard, based on figures from Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee. Ohio would lose an additional $22 million in IDEA Special Education Grants, the White House says. This is money that goes for about 270 teachers, speech and other therapists, and aides working with about 12,000 children with disabilities, according to information provided by Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Additionally, 2,500 low-income preschoolers could be stuck at home if Ohio loses an estimated $15 million in Head Start funding, according to the White House and the National Education Association. And a cut of $4.3 million in federal child care assistance could mean a loss of support for 800 Ohio children.

• Food and Workplace Safety -- Federal food inspectors would be furloughed for two weeks, forcing the plants where they work to operate fewer hours or shut down, resulting in 2,100 fewer inspections nationwide, says the White House. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration will conduct roughly 1,200 fewer inspections nationwide.

• Great Lakes Dredging and Environment -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expects a 5 percent cut, but has not determined exactly how it would be applied across its projects and programs, says spokesman Gene Pawlik. Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee say that based on the overall level of cuts, 43 dredging projects that got money in 2012 might not be funded this year. Ohio would also lose nearly 6.9 million this year in federal environmental funding that helps improve air and water quality, the White House says, and $981,000 more in grants for fish and wildlife protection.

• Housing -- About 125,000 housing choice vouchers that subsidize the rent of low-income families would not be renewed around the country, says Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan. Cuts to Homeless Assistance Grants will mean that about 100,000 formerly homeless people nationwide will lose their current housing. Reductions in HUD counseling grants will result in 75,000 fewer households around the country getting foreclosure prevention and other advice. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program would lose $185 million, making it harder to help low-income families and seniors avoid having their utilities cut off because of overdue bills.

• Internal Revenue Service -- Furloughs at IRS during tax filing season will result in longer hold times for taxpayers who seek advice at call centers, and fewer enforcement agents available to investigate fraud. Acting Treasury Secretary Neil S. Wolin said the IRS cutbacks would decrease government revenue and "further complicate deficit reduction efforts."

• Law Enforcement -- Federal court employees will face furloughs. Reduced staffing levels are expected to delay court proceedings in civil and bankruptcy cases. Fewer probation officers would be available to supervise parolees. Money for drug testing and mental health treatment for offenders would be cut by 20 percent. Funding for court security systems and equipment would be cut by 30 percent. The Justice Department says it will have fewer attorneys and law enforcement officers to prosecute cases. The Bureau of Prisons says staff furloughs and hiring reductions at prisons could jeopardize safety.

• Medicare and Medical Research -- Benefits won't change for Medicare recipients, but the government will cut reimbursements to Medicare providers, health plans and drug plans by 2 percent. The Cleveland Clinic anticipates Medicare reimbursement cuts would reduce its revenues by about $22 million this year, according to CFO Steve Glass. Glass says the Clinic may also get fewer federal dollars for education and medical research. Funding for National Institutes of Health medical research programs would be cut by about $1.6 billion nationwide. An association of research and health advocates says Ohio's share of NIH cuts could be $33.7 million, an estimate based on 2012 funding. The Cleveland Clinic has already planned for the cuts "because we can't operate with that uncertainty," says Glass.

• NASA Glenn Research Center -- The sequester would force NASA to cut its overall budget by 9 percent over the seven remaining months of the fiscal year, but the agency has not specified how individual centers would be affected. A letter that NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden, Jr., delivered to the U.S. Senate said the sequester would cut $7.3 million from the agency's $551.5 million aeronautics budget, and would result in cancellation of construction projects to repair or replace infrastructure at NASA Glenn.

• National Parks may reduce their hours of operation and limit access if there is insufficient staff on duty to ensure protection of visitors and public resources.

• Postal Service -- Won't be affected because it does not rely on tax dollars, says spokesman David Van Allen.

• Social Security -- Payments to beneficiaries will continue, but staff cuts are likely to increase wait times to reach Social Security Administration (SSA) representatives by phone and at field offices. SSA Administrator Michael J. Astrue predicts the agency's disability claim backlog would rise by over 140,000. He expects applicants will have to wait an average of an extra two weeks for a decision on initial disability claims and nearly a month longer for a disability hearing decision. Funding for senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels would be cut by $35 million, meaning these programs would serve four million fewer meals.

• Unemployment Benefits -- Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits for more than 3.8 million people nationwide will be reduced by as much as 9.4 percent, says acting Labor Secretary Seth D. Harris. Affected long-term unemployed individuals will lose an average of more than $400 in benefits.
