Format: Hardcover

I am not an American citizen but, I have always been interested in why some people succeed and what they have done to be successful. Well, in reading Donald Trump's book I came away with a clear understanding (I have read his other boks as well)why Mr. Trump is a very successful man. First, he is a take charge guy. When there are problems he meets them head on. The impression you get in reading his book is that of a man who dosn't like problems to fester. He likes to solve things right away in the most efficient manner possible. Moreover, he is a realist, which is to mean that he faces facts. This can be seen in his chapters on The Safe Streets We Deserve, The Foreign Policy We Deserve, and Freedom From Terrorism. He tells things exaclty the way they are. Another characteristic of Donald Trump although this may seem obvious is that this is a very serious man. He cares about his country. He is a very results oriented person who wants to succeed. You can see this throughout the whole book. Personally, I found the book very interesting, reading it more from the point of view of analyzing his personality. I've come away concluding that this is one very tough man, who is very smart, no-nonsense, with the attitude of "lets get down to business and do what has to be done." And to top it all off, he knows people. He seems to have the instict or talent to hire the right people around him. A very important trait for any successful person to have. It seems to me, he would make quite a President.
