I've pasted the data and sources related to your two questions below. Please let us know if we can provide anything further.

Black abortions per day

The CDC reports that 35% of aborted babies are black (for context, approximately 12% of the U.S. population is black).

The CDC estimates 623,639 abortions in the most recent year available (2014) from 49 "reporting areas." California, Maryland, and New Hampshire did not provide any data.

The Guttmacher Institute's estimate for the same time period is 926,200.

35% of 926,200 = 888 per day

35% of the estimated 60 million babies aborted since Roe v. Wade = 1,302 per day

There is no way to know an exact figure since not all states report abortion data and the tally does not include illegal or unreported abortions. However, "as many as 1,000 per day" as stated in the LWV survey response is a reasonable, conservative estimate based on available data.

Cause of death

The top three causes of death reported by the CDC based on death certificates for the most recent year available (2015) for black Americans are:

Heart disease: 75,249

Cancer: 69,389

Stroke: 17,988

Based on the CDC estimate that 35% of babies aborted are black and the estimates mentioned above that 623,000-926,000 abortions were performed in 2014, between 218,273 and 324,100 black babies were aborted. This is far more than the leading reported cause of death for black Americans.

Weâ€™ll review, thanks.

Did any entity or expert outside the campaign do any research that fed into the claim? If so, point us to the research?
