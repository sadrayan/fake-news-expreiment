THE NEW VIETNAM
**ADVANCE FOR SUNDAY, APRIL 24** Vietnamese workers put the finishing touches on a production line making athletic shoes at the Nike factory on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon Feb. 22, 2005. Drawn to Vietnam a decade ago, Nike, the country's single largest private employer with some 130,000 employees, produces some US$700 million worth of footwear from Vietnam, making it the third largest supplier behind China and Indonesia. Vietnam churns out IKEA housewares, Victoria's Secret lingerie, Gap clothing and Nike tennis shoes for the world, about US$6 billion in exports went to the U.S. market alone. The legacy of a wartime pariah teetering on the edge of near-economic collapse has been all but forgotten in the headlong rush to secure a competitive slot in the global race.
