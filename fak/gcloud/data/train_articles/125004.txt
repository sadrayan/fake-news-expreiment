Crocodile Dundee reboot outed as advertising campaign for Tourism Australia
Those incredulous reactions to the weekend's trailer teasing a Crocodile Dundee reboot may have had a point – it all looks to be a viral marketing stunt.

Industry sources have indicated the teaser – featuring US actor Danny McBride – is part of an advertising campaign for Tourism Australia, set to air during next month's NFL Super Bowl.

The teaser, revealed exclusively by People magazine on Saturday, touted the big-screen return of Paul Hogan's iconic adventurer, with McBride playing his "loudmouthed American son" Brian Dundee, on a mission to rescue his father who is lost in the Australian outback.

The clip was met with scepticism from certain corners of the industry, with film publications questioning how the shoot for the film – apparently set for release in June – could have flown under the radar.
