San Franciscans are needed to help Ghandi Brigade and Code Pink hold a 24hour vigil in front of Nancy Pelosi's residence in SF urging the passage of HR 508, the Out of Iraq Bill introduced by Woolsey and to DEFEAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL.





Member of Ghandi Peace Brigade and Code Pink are holding a 24hour vigil demanding the Speaker of the House to stop funding the war. These activists have taken refuge on the corner of Broadway and Normandie in Pacific Heights.



"We can not have business as usual.", said Rene of Code Pink, "as long as she is funding the war she is NOT representing us. We are going to hold court in the street until the vote happens. COME JOIN US! Stop the war funding and perhaps prevent the potential attack on Iran. WE NEED YOU!"
