Toyota to Invest $1.3 Billion in Kentucky Plant
DETROIT — In the latest move by a major automaker to enhance its American manufacturing operations, Toyota said on Monday that it would invest more than $1.3 billion to upgrade its assembly plant in Kentucky.

The announcement follows a push by President Trump for auto companies to expand in the United States, and it follows similar actions by General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler.

The investment will not add jobs at Toyota’s plant in Georgetown, Ky., but a company spokesman, Scott Vazin, said the investment “solidifies its commitment” to manufacturing vehicles in the United States.

Asked if Mr. Trump’s policies played a role in the decision, Mr. Vazin said, “No, but we do share his goal of growing the economy and jobs in the U.S.”
