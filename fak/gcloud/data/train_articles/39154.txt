Viral lies: Can you be ticketed for having a phone in your hand while driving?
I won't make you scroll.

The answer is no. Not yet.

But still, this post on Facebook stating otherwise has been shared over 100,000 times. As a millennial who needs her GPS to get out of a paper bag (that she probably got herself into by not using her GPS) I felt panic bubble up when I saw this post.

It was posted at the end of February and states that Florida passed a new law that if a police officer so much as sees you with your cell phone in hand that you can be written an expensive ticket.

Well, according to the DMV Florida website, which is linked in the post, that is not true. Cell phones are said to be a distraction and you will be written a ticket if you break a road rule while using your phone, but that ticket will be for reckless driving, distracted driving, etc.

Texting while driving is illegal in Florida, but it is a secondary law, meaning that you cannot be pulled over if an officer thinks you're texting. You can, however, be pulled over for speeding or swerving and also written a ticket for texting.

Recently, a bill has gone through the House of Representatives that would make texting while driving illegal in Florida as a first offense but has gone to the Senate where it still sits.

I am not sure how this information got into the internet-sphere when the link debunking this is literally in the post. It's important to check facts, I really can't say it enough. The internet is the friend who tells you that you look cute and then makes everyone laugh and point when your back is turned; don't trust her.
