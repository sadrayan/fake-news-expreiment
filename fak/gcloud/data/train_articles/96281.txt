REACTION HAS BEEN, SHALL WESAY, MIXED.THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE BEENVERY ENTHUSIASTIC, SENDING INNOTES AND STOPPING ME AS I'MWALKING AROUND IN THINGS ISREALLY EXCITING AND THEN THEREARE SOME FOLKS THAT HAVECODEWORDS.YOU ARE 72 YEARS OLD, YOU WERETOO OLD.HE GAVE THE KEY TO THE CITY TOFIDEL CASTRO.MIKE: IN 1975.MAYOR SOGLIN: YES, IT WAS A FEWYEARS AGO.THE POINT IS THOSE ARE NEGATIVESTHAT REALLY TRANSLATES PEOPLEDON'T LIKE MY POLITICS.IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUETHAT ELECTION IS DECIDED ABOUT.MIKE: WHY YOU SAY THAT?YOUR AGE ARE YOUR ONE TIME TRIPTO CUBA?MAYOR SOGLIN WE'VE DONE SOMEPOLLING, AND WE WERE CURIOUSDOES AGE MAKE A DIFFERENCE?THE BOTTOM LINE IS, IT DOESN'T.PARTICULARLY WE GOT TWO OTHERPIECES OF EVIDENCE.FIRST, WHAT HAPPENED WITH BERNIESANDERS, WHERE CLEARLY AGE WASNOT A DETRIMENT.SECONDLY, IF YOU LOOK AT THEBIGGEST CADRE OF VOTERS, THOSEWHO ARE OVER THE AGE OF 50 YEARSOLD, THAT DOESN'T PLAY WELL.MIKE: YOU'VE LIKENED THISPOSSIBILITY TO THE SANDERSCAMPAIGN.YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED HERE INWISCONSIN.WHAT WOULD BE THE MESSAGE TOWISCONSIN RESIDENTS IF YOU WERETO RUN?MAYOR SOGLIN: LET'S SEE IF I CANDO THIS CONCISELY.FIRST, I HAVE A VERY DIFFERENTECONOMIC PHILOSOPHY THAN THEGOVERNOR.I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THE PUBLICWORDS IN PARTNERSHIP AND THATMEANS PUBLIC INVESTMENT ANDTHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED INMADISON.WE INVESTED IN EDUCATION, WEINVESTED IN INFRASTRUCTURE,MONONA TERRACE, THAT CREATESJOBS, BUT MORE REPORTEDLY AGREEDTO PRIVATE INVESTMENT.IF YOU LOOK AT THE MADISON TAXROLLS, IF YOU LOOK AT THEPOPULATION GROWTH, IF YOU LOOKAT THE FACT THAT WHEN GOVERNORWALKER AND I BOTH TOOK OFFICE IN2011 WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF ONEANOTHER, 60,000 NEW JOBS HAVEBEEN CREATED IN THE STATE.40,000 OF THEM WERE CREATED INMADISON AND THE MADISON AREA.CLEARLY WE ARE DOING SOMETHINGRIGHT, AND THAT')S NOT THE STATEGOVERNMENT OR THE UNIVERSITY,BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR CUT THOSEBACK.MIKE: DO YOU SEE MADISON, IF YOUWERE TO RUN FOR OFFICE, DO YOUSEE MADISON AS AN ASSET ORLIABILITY?IT WOULD BE LOOKED AT AS ONE OFTHOSE MADISON GUYS?MAYOR SOGLIN: IF YOU LOOK AROUNDTHE STATE, WE ARE ONE OF THEEMINEM'S -- MM'S, MADISON ANDMILWAUKEE.WHEN I WAS MAYOR, I MADE ACOMMITMENT TO SEE THE BENEFITSOF INVESTMENT OF JOBS ANDEDUCATION AND BETTER HEALTH CAREWENT TO EVERYONE.I CAN SAY THE SAME THING INTERMS OF MY SERVICE AS AGOVERNOR.IT'S EVERYBODY AND IS ADIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY THAN WE'VEGOT NOW.IT'S THIS FOCUS ON BUILDING THATPUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP ANDGETTING INVESTMENT THROUGHOUTTHE STATE.MIKE HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBEGOVERNOR WALKER'S PERFORMANCE?MAYOR SOGLIN: WE CAN LOOK AT ITTWO WAYS.FIRST, WE CAN GO BACKWARD SINCETHE RECESSION OR BEFORE AND THESTATE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, BUTTHAT'S BASED ON 2007, 2000.WHEN YOU COMPARE US TO OUR PEERSWERE TO THE OTHER 50 STATES,COMPARE US TO MINNESOTA.COMPARE US TO IOWA.ILLINOIS A DIFFERENT CASE, THEYARE IN TOTAL CHAOS.BUT WHEN YOU COMPARE US TO OURCOMPETITIVE STATES, WE ARE NOTDOING AS WELL.IN FACT, WE ARE SLIPPING.THE GOVERNOR GOES AROUND SAYINGWE ARE IN THE TOP 10 IN TERMS OFHIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES.THE GOVERNOR IS RIGHT.BUT HE DOESN'T FINISH THESENTENCE.WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE, WEWERE SECOND IN THE STATE.NOW WE ARE EIGHTH.WE'RE GOING DOWNHILL.MIKE: I WANT TO GET YOURREACTION IS SOMETHING HE SAID.HE DID HAVE A REACTION WHEN YOUHEARD YOU WERE RUNNING FOROFFICE, HE SAID HE WOULD LOVETHAT CONTRAST.THINK YOU REFERRED TO YOU AS ANUNABASHE THROWBACK TO THE 60'S,A RADICAL LIBERAL.WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?MAYOR SOGLIN: THAT'S WHY WE AREGETTING ALL THIS INVESTMENT INMADISON, THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEINGONE OF THE MOST VIBRANT,HIGH-TECH ZONES IN THE UNITEDSTATES.THAT'S WHY WE ARE IN THE TOP 20CITIES IN TERMS OFENTREPRENEURSHIP.WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENEDIN TERMS OF THE CHANGE IN THISCOUNTRY, WE ALL KNOW WHAT THEINTERNET IS DOING.MADISON IS RESPONDING ANDGETTING AHEAD OF THE CURVE, ANDTHERE IS NO REASON THE REST OFTHE STATE CAN'T.BUT WE TALK ABOUT THE INTERNET,FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN HAVETREMENDOUSLY VIBRANCE BUSINESSESIN ANY CORNER OF THE STATE, IF,IT IS NOT JUST DOWNLOAD SPEED,WE HAVE TO HAVE UPLOAD SPEED ASWELL.WHY DON'T WE HAVE A VIABLENETWORK HERE IN THE STATE OFWISCONSIN?WAS BEEN GOING ON THE LAST SIXYEARS?THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON INMADISON THAT OUGHT TO BESTATEWIDE.SAME THING IN TERMS OFTRANSPORTATION.MIKE: FINAL QUESTION, MONEY.YOU KNOW ANY DEMOCRATICCANDIDATE KNOWS IF YOU TAKE ONGOVERNOR WALKER YOU PROBABLY AREGOING TO BE SWIMMING UPSTREAM INTERMS OF FUNDRAISING.HOW YOU DEAL WITH THAT?MAYOR SOGLIN: I KNOW I'M NOTGETTING DONALD TRUMP, BUT THENAGAIN, THERE ARE OTHERCANDIDATES THAT HAVEDEMONSTRATED THAT YOU CAN GO ONTHE INTERNET AND IN FIVES ANDTENS AND $50 INCREMENTS, YOU CANBUILD A VIABLE CAMPAIGN.I WOULD GUESS THE GOVERNORWALKER IS GOING TO RAISE $30MILLION.I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS THAT WE CANGET MUCH PAST $15 MILLION OR $20MILLION.BUT I THINK WE HAD THAT AMOUNT,THERE WILL BE A VIBRANT CAMPAIGNTHROUGHOUT THE STATE AND INAREAS WHERE I'M NOT PARTICULARLYPOPULAR, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ACRUSHING DEFEAT.WE ARE GOING BE ABLE TO RUN 45%,47% AND THEN HOPEFULLY, THINGSWILL TURN OUT WITH A SOLIDMAJORITY.MIKE: I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDSIN YOUR MOUTH, BUT YOU SOUNDVERY MUCH LIKE YOU ARE RUNNINGTHIS CAMPAIGN.YOU SOUND LIKE A CANDIDATE TOME.MAYOR SOGLIN: YOU ARE ASKINGQUESTIONS THAT I HAVE THOUGHTABOUT AND I'M PREPARED -- I'MGETTING PREPARED FOR THIS.MIKE MADISON MAYOR PAUL
