Michelle Obama’s Face To Be Plastered All Over Fast Food Chain
Are you tired of seeing Michelle Obama’s face? Would it make you sick to see her while you’re eating?

If the answer is yes, then I’m truly, very sorry. Because, in accordance with Michelle’s ‘Let’s Move’ campaign, her face will now be plastered all over McDonald’s restaurants across the country.

I know, I’m just as grossed out as you are.

And are we, the taxpayers, supposed to foot this bill? Are we going to be forced to PAY MONEY so that we can watch Michelle’s face while we eat?

Honestly, where is the boundary between business and government?

How do you feel about Michelle’s face being plastered all over McDonald’s?

Will you boycott McDonald’s for sinking this low? Are you outraged that your tax dollars are going towards this?
