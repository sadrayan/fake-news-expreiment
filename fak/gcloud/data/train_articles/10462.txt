Subject: CAUCUS MEMO: Overview of Delegate Counts for Nevada’s First in the West Democratic Presidential Caucus

Date: Wednesday, November 18, 2015

With just three months to go before Nevada’s presidential caucuses, the Nevada State Democratic Party is committed to ensuring a smooth and transparent process on February 20, 2016. Today, we are providing a detailed overview of precinct delegate count information to all Democratic presidential campaigns and our caucus partners in Nevada. The apportionment of delegates is based on Democratic voter registration numbers on Monday, November 2, 2015, in accordance with the Nevada State Democratic Party’s Delegate Selection Plan.

Delegate Ratios and Methodology

Precinct delegates in Nevada are apportioned based on a series of ratios specified in the Nevada Revised Statutes. Every precinct is entitled to at least one delegate. A precinct’s total number of delegates is based on a ratio determined by the number of registered Democrats in that county.

County Category Registered Democrats Precinct Delegate Ratio A 400 or fewer 1 delegate per 5 registered Democrats B 401 - 600 1 delegate per 8 registered Democrats C 601 - 800 1 delegate per 10 registered Democrats D 801 – 1,400 1 delegate per 15 registered Democrats E 1,401 – 2,000 1 delegate per 20 registered Democrats F 2,001 – 3,000 1 delegate per 30 registered Democrats G 3,001 – 4,000 1 delegate per 35 registered Democrats H 4,001 or more 1 delegate per 50 registered Democrats

The results of the ratio formula will be rounded up at 0.5 or higher and rounded down below 0.5. Here’s an example of how it works: Mineral County has 1,089 registered Democrats, which falls under precinct apportionment category D: 1 delegate per 15 registered Democrats in each precinct. Precinct 1 in Mineral County has 124 Democrats, which is divided by 15 and rounded down to determine that the precinct receives 8 delegates.

Delegate Selection Process

The precinct caucuses on February 20 are the first step of Nevada’s delegate selection process. Any Nevadan who wants to be elected as a national delegate must participate in the precinct caucuses and each subsequent part of the process: the county convention on April 2 and the state convention on May 14 and 15. Nevada will ultimately send a total of 43 delegates and three alternates to the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia fromJuly 25 through July 28:

National Delegate Category Delegates Alternates District-Level Delegates 23 2 Unpledged Party Leader and Elected Official Delegates 8 0 Pledged Party Leaders and Elected Officials 5 0 At-Large Delegates 7 1

The 23 national delegates and two alternates awarded from Nevada’s four Congressional Districts are allocated to each candidate based on the percentage of the precinct caucus vote on February 20. A 15 percent threshold is required for candidates to be awarded any delegates. The 2016 Congressional District delegates are apportioned based on total population and the average vote for Democratic candidates in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.

Congressional District Delegates Alternates CD-1 5 1 CD-2 6 0 CD-3 6 1 CD-4 6 0

Frequently Asked Questions

Why do some smaller counties appear to have a disproportionate number of delegates compared to larger counties?

When the rules and ratios regarding delegate apportionment were designed for Nevada, the intent of legislators was to slightly favor smaller, more rural counties. These counties will generally have a disproportionate number of delegates compared to larger counties.

For example: Esmeralda County has 122 Democrats and 25 delegates, while Lincoln County has 711 Democrats and 71 delegates. Lincoln County has more more than five times the number of registered Democrats compared to Esmeralda County, but less than three times the number of delegates.

In addition, the Nevada Revised Statutes provide that any precinct in any county with at least one registered Democrat shall receive at least one delegate. Therefore, some counties appear to have disproportionate numbers of delegates due to the fact that they have precincts that are entitled to have one delegate even though they only have a few registered Democrats.

Why do some precincts have one delegate when they have less than half the ratio provided in the Nevada Revised Statutes?

Every precinct with at least one registered Democrat is entitled to one delegate. If the ratio for a given precinct is 50 but they only have 24 registered Democrats, the precinct is still entitled to one delegate – even though mathematically it would round down to zero.

Why are “inactive voters” included? What is the difference between “active” and “inactive” voters?

The number of delegates is calculated based on the number of registered Democratic voters in a given county and precinct. By definition, inactive voters are still registered and eligible to vote in all elections.

Only by missing two federal general elections after being marked inactive would someone be purged from the voter rolls, and at that point they would not count in delegate apportionment. We anticipate no purges of the voter rolls between now and February 20, 2016.
