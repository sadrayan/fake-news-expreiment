FBI Baltimore History — FBI
1940s and 1950s

With the onset of World War II, the division made national security concerns its top priority. In 1939, a few months before the war actually began in Europe, FBI Headquarters made sure that Baltimore and several other key field divisions had assigned a special agent to concentrate on national security matters. Within a year, many agents were working these issues in Baltimore. By October 1941, 30 agents were handling a total of more than 2,500 investigations in the division.

National security concerns continued into the early years of the Cold War. The Baltimore Division was responsible for espionage investigations at such key facilities as the Aberdeen Proving Ground and the new headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Meade. So many criminal, security, and background investigations were being launched by the division that the Army set up a room at the Proving Grounds for Baltimore agents working with military law enforcement and counterintelligence personnel. Agents pursued leads in many intelligence-related cases—from the investigation of Alger Hiss, who had grown up in Baltimore, to that of William Weisband, a Soviet agent who penetrated the Army Signals Service, a predecessor of the NSA.

Criminal matters were also important during this time. Sometimes, such investigations ended tragically. In September 1953, Special Agent John Brady Murphy of the Baltimore office was shot to death while pursuing John Elgin Johnson, a murder suspect and parole violator. Murphy had tracked Johnson to a Baltimore theatre, where he was surprised by the fugitive and fatally wounded. Other Baltimore agents quickly tracked down Johnson, who perished in a shoot-out while resisting capture.
