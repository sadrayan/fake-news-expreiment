Ben Carson Scores Big Win at the First GOP Debate followed by Marco Rubio
WASHINGTON, Aug. 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- One America News Network, "OAN", a credible source for 24/7 national and international news, released this evening its Post GOP Debate Poll results conducted by Gravis Marketing. Two primary questions asked to Republican polled participants were "Who do you think won the debate?" and "Who do you think lost the debate?" GOP Presidential Candidates Ben Carson and Marco Rubio scored well in both categories. Donald Trump came in second on the question of "who won the debate?" but he also scored second on "who lost the debate?" showing a heavily polarized Republican base when it comes to their post-debate opinions of the New York Businessman. Rand Paul and Chris Christie did not have a good evening, with both scoring at the bottom of "who won?" and Paul taking the lead of "who lost?" with Christie coming in a distant third, behind Trump.

Who Won the Debate? % Who Lost the Debate? % Ben Carson 22% Rand Paul 34% Donald Trump 19% Donald Trump 30% Marco Rubio 13% Chris Christie 9% Jeb Bush 10% Jeb Bush 7% Mike Huckabee 9% John Kasich 4% John Kasich 8% Ben Carson 4% Ted Cruz 7% Mike Huckabee 4% Scott Walker 7% Ted Cruz 4% Rand Paul 3% Scott Walker 2% Chris Christie 2% Marco Rubio 2%

Polled registered Republican voters were also asked, "Do you have a more favorable or less favorable opinion of (each candidate) after the debate?" Poll results clearly show that Ben Carson won the first GOP debate in the minds of Republican voters with Marco Rubio coming in second place. Rand Paul had a rough evening, uncharacteristic of his general performance in state and national polls.

GOP Candidate More Favorable? Less Favorable? Unchanged? Ben Carson 80% 9% 11% Marco Rubio 68% 13% 19% Mike Huckabee 60% 18% 22% Scott Walker 58% 17% 25% Ted Cruz 57% 19% 23% John Kasich 54% 18% 28% Jeb Bush 48% 27% 25% Chris Christie 41% 33% 26% Donald Trump 36% 45% 19% Rand Paul 14% 67% 19%

According to Robert Herring, Sr., CEO of One America News Network, "Dr. Ben Carson had a wonderful evening. He was articulate and, at times, funny. Carson stayed out of the verbal jabbing that cost Christie and Paul some points this evening."

Gravis Marketing, a nonpartisan research firm, conducted a random survey of 904 registered Republican voters across the U.S. Questions included in the poll were focused only on the top ten GOP candidates that participated in the 9 PM ET debate. The poll has an overall margin of error of +/- 3%. The polls were conducted on August 6, immediately following the GOP debate using interactive voice response, IVR, technology.
