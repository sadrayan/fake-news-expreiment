Lie can go around the world . . . (1854)

Here's a follow-up to Barry's earlier contribution regarding "A lie can go around the world and back while the truth is lacing up its boots" (1854), http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0403E&L=ads-l&P=R403 >From the EARLY AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS database (1690-1876): [An excerpt from "Manslaughter," The Boston Commercial Gazette; 7 September 1820; Vol. 55; Issue 19; Pg. 2; Reprinted from The Portland Gazette, 5 September.] The public mind has been too much inflamed in this transaction, by misrepresentations -- these the examination have materially corrected, but the influence of the corrective, does not extend as far as the injury of the falsehood: "for falsehood will fly from Maine to Georgia, while truth is pulling her boots on." ------------------------------------------------ Perhaps the "truth/boots" version derives from the following still earlier form. -- Bonnie Taylor-Blake >From the EARLY AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS database (1690-1876): [From The Farmer's Cabinet; 2 February 1808; Vol. VI; Issue 14; Pg. 4.] "Falsehood," says one, "flies and truth comes limping after it." If a lie be believed sometimes only for an hour, it has accomplished its purpose, and there is no further occasion for it. [From "Quere," The Commercial Advertiser, 16 March 1804; Issue 1995; Pg. 3.] A few bold lies may have effected their purpose, before truth can overtake and defeat them. Falsehood always flies, but truth frequently goes with a limping gait. >From Gale's EIGHTEENTH CENTURY COLLECTIONS ONLINE database: [From Jonathan Swift's "The Examiner," No. 14, Thursday, 9 November 1710.] Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after it; so that when men come to be undeceived, it is too late; the jest is over, and the tale has had its effect: Like a man, who has the thought of a good repartee, when the discourse is changed, or the company parted; or like a physician, who hath found out an infallible medicine, after the patient is dead.
