Gov. Bruce Rauner’s plan to reform the school funding formula would send more money to the neediest school districts in Illinois. The Illinois State Board of Education conducted an analysis which was released on Aug. 12. The analysis found that 97.5 percent of the 852 school districts in Illinois receive more state funding under the governor’s plan compared to Senate Bill 1, as written. Under the governor’s plan, no school district would receive less funding this upcoming school year than it received last year.
