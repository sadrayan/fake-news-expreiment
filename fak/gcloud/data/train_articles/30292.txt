Support for the Caribbean
As a company that cares deeply about the communities we serve, Carnival stands in solidarity and support for our brothers and sisters throughout the Caribbean, a region that holds a special place in our hearts. We are proud to join with our destination partners to assist residents and communities following Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, while providing financial support to a wide variety of relief organizations and doing our part to help the region in its recovery.



You can help too. Carnival is accepting donations on behalf of UNICEF USA, which is mobilizing to get immediate, critical support to children and families throughout the Caribbean with 100 percent of every dollar spent through this program assisting children.



Carnival is the leader in Caribbean cruising and each day 60,000 guests are enjoying fun, relaxing vacations sailing to beautiful island destinations. We continue to operate our normal schedules with attractive ports substituted for the handful of destinations that have been impacted by the storms. We are pleased to report that our ships have now returned to Grand Turk and San Juan. Now more than ever, our destination partners need our help and there is no better way to show support for the region than by continuing to visit.



We will be resuming calls to St. Thomas and St. Maarten early next month. All of the other Western Caribbean, Southern Caribbean and Bahamian ports we visit are fully operational and ready to provide our guests with a terrific experience ashore. We have adjusted our itineraries that were scheduled to call on these two ports and the revised itineraries offer a great mix of exciting ports of call.



We look forward to continuing to provide our guests with exceptional and memorable cruise experiences and assisting our homeport and port of call communities during this time.



Our thoughts continue to be with everyone affected by these storms.
