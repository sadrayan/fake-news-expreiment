Dean Heller for US Senate
LAS VEGAS – Unbelievable. Congresswoman Jacky Rosen went AWOL on Nevada’s veterans once again yesterday when she skipped work to attend a publicity stunt instead of voting to expand coverage for Vietnam War heroes who are literally dying from exposure to Agent Orange – a bill Dean Heller has cosponsored in the Senate.

If a trip to the southern border was so important to her, Rosen could’ve traveled over the weekend. Instead, she chose to pal around Nevada with Elizabeth Warren and—at the expense of these veterans—ignore the job she was elected to do.

Unfortunately, this is just more of what Nevadans have come to expect from the rookie congresswoman.

After just six months on her current job and accomplishing nothing, Congresswoman Rosen asked for a promotion. She has proven herself to be a one trick pony that relies on photo ops and publicity stunts to further her political career instead of actually delivering results for the Nevadans she represents.

And worse yet, this isn’t the first time Rosen has abandoned the nearly 90,000 Vietnam War heroes that call Nevada home. She chose to fundraise with Jane Fonda just a couple of months ago, and even more insulting, the event was announced on National Vietnam War Veterans Day.

Hanoi Jane incensed our military when she traveled to North Vietnam and posed for a photo with an anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down American pilots; recorded radio broadcasts meant to shame our troops; and called our POWs “hypocrites and liars” whose torture was “understandable.”

“Jacky Rosen has once again chosen herself and her political career over Nevada’s Vietnam War heroes,” Heller campaign spokesman Keith Schipper said. “This job is not about attending photo ops and glitzy fundraisers – it’s about standing up for Nevadans. While Jacky goes AWOL, Dean Heller is fighting day in and day out for Nevada’s veterans and delivering the benefits, care, and support that they’ve earned.”
