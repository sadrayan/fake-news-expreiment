Example: [Collected via Twitter, August 2015]

Origins: On 30 August 2015, the “Lost in History” Twitter account (@SadHappyAmazing) posted two images (displayed above) purportedly showing actors James Dean and Marilyn Monroe posing together.

Neither of those two images was real, however. One was composite created from two separate photographs, while the other was a piece of artwork by Paul Gasenheimer.
