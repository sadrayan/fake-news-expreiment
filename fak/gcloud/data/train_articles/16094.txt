Study Ex Sum (which is what is linked) looks OK; data isn’t sourced but orders of magnitude look correct (I’m guessing its all based on the Tech America definition of technology by industry sector and publicly-available data on jobs and economic output). The study says that tech accounts for 21% of the Austin economy directly (as measured by gross product) and more than one-third when the ripple effects are included; I’d say the verb “drives” (which to me implies more than the direct effect) makes the President’s remark consistent with the study’s findings.
