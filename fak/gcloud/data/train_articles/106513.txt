Protesters Storm Gov’t Building, Burn County Flag, Hoist ‘Antifa’ Flag
I didn't serve in the U.S. Military for 20+ years to allow violence to be used under ANY circumstances to get your point across. Violence has a place and that is to ONLY protect oneself, or family, from violence on the part of another. Peaceful demonstrations, rallies, and speaking engagements ARE effective ways to let others know how you feel.

The most effective way to get your way is to get everyone you know, and everyone they know, to vote for the candidate that believes as you do. NO politician wants to be ousted from a cushy, well paying job. Only through effective control of the government can we begin to see change take effect.

As for the perpetrators of violence at ANY time, they should be dealt with swiftly and penalized to the fullest extent of the law. Demonstrations, rallies, and like events should NEVER be excuses or masks for violence. This only serves to hurt and diminish one's cause and beliefs. It is up to all of us to ensure that we ALL do what is right. The person(s) breaking the law during a protest is only hurting the rest of the demonstrators cause. If the perpetrators are not being reported by other demonstrators, or bystanders, then the time, the energy, and the cause of the innocent parties is in vain.

I do my ABSOLUTE best to view everything from a neutral position until I know all of the facts. In this day and age, i can't afford to be from the Left or Right politically. EVERY side has its' Good/Bad points. NO ONE is always right. EVERYONE makes mistakes.

We will NEVER all get along, but at least we should be able to respect each others' right to an opinion even if we don't respect or believe in that opinion.

Thank you!
