3 How much does it cost?

The toll is as low as 30-cents per section when traffic is light, but increases when traffic is heavier to prevent the lane from becoming congested. Most of the time the average toll rate has been less than $4.00 during rush hour, but sometimes the rate peaks much higher for brief periods. Once you are in the lane, you will never pay more than the amount posted on the sign.
