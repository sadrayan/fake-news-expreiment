Division of Blood Diseases and Resources
Blood diseases affect millions of people each year in the United States. These congenital and acquired diseases, including the anemias, venous thromboembolism, hemophilia, and other bleeding disorders, impact the normal biology of red and white blood cells, platelets, bone marrow, vascular endothelium, and plasma proteins. They also manifest a wide range of symptoms, generating the need for preventive, therapeutic, and curative approaches to restoring health.

The DBDR is divided into three branches that are structured to facilitate team science in priority areas of blood science. Together, the branches foster the training of the next generation of blood scientists, coordinate blood research activities, and promote communication across the Division, the NHLBI, the NIH, and partner federal agencies.
