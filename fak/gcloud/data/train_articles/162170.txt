Always Pads Testing Results
What’s Hiding in Always Pads?

In August 2014 Women’s Voices for the Earth commissioned testing of four types of Always menstrual pads, manufactured by Procter & Gamble. The certified laboratory STAT Analysis Corporation analyzed the products for volatile organic compound. These data represent the first publicly available test results of this kind for these products. Both scented and unscented Always Ultra Thin pads were tested, as well as scented and unscented Always Infinity.

The results of the testing indicate that both scented and unscented Always pads emit toxic chemicals, including chemicals identified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Toxicology Program, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the State of California Environmental Protection Agency as carcinogens, and reproductive and developmental toxins. None of these chemicals are disclosed on the product by the manufacturer.

Procter & Gamble does not disclose the identity of the materials used to manufacture its menstrual pads. Thus it remains unclear which components of the pad may be the source of the volatile toxic emissions. The testing results demonstrate the need for more testing of these products to better characterize the chemical exposures and to better understand the potential health impacts of those exposures.

Products Tested

Always Ultra Thin unscented

Always Ultra Thin Clean Scent

Always Infinity unscented

Always Radiant Infinity Light Clean Scent

Methodology

Analysis of the samples for volatile organic compounds was conducted by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with EPA Method TO-15 using headspace containers.

Results

The Always menstrual pads were found to contain several chemicals of concern, including the following:

Styrene: carcinogen

Chloromethane: reproductive toxicant

Chloroethane: carcinogen

Chloroform: carcinogen, reproductive toxicant, neurotoxin

Acetone: irritant.
