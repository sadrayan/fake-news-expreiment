See The Rock Wearing a Fanny Pack and Handcuffs!

Fanny pack and lean take it to a whole other level… Posted by Dwayne The Rock Johnson on Wednesday, July 16, 2014

Some people can get away with wearing just about anything.Take the fanny pack, for instance. Most of us see it as accessory of soccer moms and vacationing tourists. But not Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.On the set of next year's Central Intelligence, Johnson plays a character named Bob. And judging by a photo on Johnson's Instagram page , Bob is partial to wearing a fanny pack – fashionably paired with a Public Enemy T-shirt, of course.It's apparently the perfect thing to wear when you're being arrested by a SWAT team."Walking contradiction of a character," Johnson, 42, says about Bob. "Extremely lovable dude when happy, but extremely deadly dude when pissed off. #ThisIsBob #AndBobHatesBullies #ButLovesPublicEnemy #OnSet #SWATSGonnaNeedBiggerCuffs"He continues, "CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE (and a Bob's fanny pack)... COMING SUMMER 2016."In the film, Johnson plays a CIA contract killer who reunites with his high school friend, an accountant, whom he recruits into a covert operation. Kevin Hart co-stars.It's not the first time that Johnson has worn a fanny pack. In a vintage photo from the '90s, he sports one with a turtleneck, gold chain and mom jeans. We have helpfully included that photo below.The moral of the story: when you're 6'5" of solid muscle, you can wear whatever you want.
