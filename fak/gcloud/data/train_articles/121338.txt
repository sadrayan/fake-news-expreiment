Approved: Resolution sponsored by Commissioner Rebeca Sosa urging Florida Legislature to make texting while driving a primary offense

(MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FL) – The Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners has approved a resolution sponsored by Commissioner Rebeca Sosa urging the Florida Legislature to make texting while driving a primary offense.

“Texting while driving is destroying lives every day. We need to address the disturbing reality that texting while driving makes the likelihood of a crash 23 times greater,” affirms Commissioner Sosa.

As of July 2015, 46 states have banned texting while driving. Florida is among the five states that do not enforce texting while driving as a primary offense, but instead as a secondary offense. Local governments, including Miami-Dade County, are preempted by the State from regulating the use of electronic communications devices in motor vehicles.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 2013 an estimated 904,000 crashes occurred involving distracted drivers with approximately 424,000 people injured and 3,154 killed.

“Texting while driving is a great danger to public safety and it must be treated as a primary offense in order to prevent more fatalities,” concluded Commissioner Sosa.
