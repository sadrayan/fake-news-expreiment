Exhibit 10.3 NFL PLAYER CONTRACT THIS CONTRACT is between Arian Foster, hereinafter Player, and Houston NFL Holdings, L.P., a Delaware corporation (limited partnership) (partnership), hereinafter Club operating under the name of the Houston Texans as a member of the National Football League, hereinafter League. In consideration of the promises made by each to the other, Player and Club agree as follows: 1. TERM. This contract covers 5 football season(s), and will begin on the date of execution or March 1, 2012, whichever is later, and end on February 28 or 29, 2017, unless extended, terminated, or renewed as specified elsewhere in this contract. 2. EMPLOYMENT AND SERVICES. Club employs Player as a skilled football player. Player accepts such employment. He agrees to give his best efforts and loyalty to the Club, and to conduct himself on and off the field with appropriate recognition of the fact that the success of professional football depends largely on public respect for and approval of those associated with the game. Player will report promptly for and participate fully in Clubs official mandatory mini-camp(s), official preseason training camp, all Club meetings and practice sessions, and all pre-season, regular season, and post-season football games scheduled for or by Club. If invited, Player will practice for and play in any all-star football game sponsored by the League. Player will not participate in any football game not sponsored by the League unless the game is first approved by the League. 3. OTHER ACTIVITIES. Without prior written consent of the Club, Player will not play football or engage in activities related to football otherwise than for Club or engage in any activity other than football which may involve a significant risk of personal injury. Player represents that he has special, exceptional and unique knowledge, skill, ability, and experience as a football player, the loss of which cannot be estimated with any certainty and cannot be fairly or adequately compensated by damages. Player therefore agrees that Club will have the right, in addition to any other right which Club may possess, to enjoin Player by appropriate proceedings from playing football or engaging in football-related activities other than for Club or from engaging in any activity other than football which may involve a significant risk of personal injury. 4. PUBLICITY AND NFLPA GROUP LICENSING PROGRAM. (a) Player grants to Club and the League, separately and together, the authority to use his name and picture for publicity and the promotion of NFL Football, the League or any of its member clubs in newspapers, magazines, motion pictures, game programs and roster manuals, broadcasts and telecasts, and all other publicity and advertising media, provided such publicity and promotion does not constitute an endorsement by Player of a commercial product. Player will cooperate with the news media, and will participate upon request in reasonable activities to promote the Club and the League. Player and National Football League Players Association, hereinafter NFLPA, will not contest the rights of the League and its member clubs to telecast, broadcast, or otherwise transmit NFL Football or the right of NFL Films to produce, sell, market, or distribute football game film footage, except insofar as such broadcast, telecast, or transmission of footage is used in any commercially marketable game or interactive use. The League and its member clubs, and Player and the NFLPA, reserve their respective rights as to the use of such broadcasts, telecasts or transmissions of footage in such games or interactive uses, which shall be unaffected by this subparagraph. (b) Player hereby assigns to the NFLPA and its licensing affiliates, if any, the exclusive right to use and to grant to persons, firms, or corporations (collectively licensees) the right to use his name, signature facsimile, voice, picture, photograph, likeness, and/or biographical information (collectively image) in group licensing programs. Group licensing programs are defined as those licensing programs in which a licensee utilizes a total of six (6) or more NFL player images on or in conjunction with products, (including, but not limited to, trading cards, clothing, videogames. computer games, collectibles, internet sites, fantasy games, etc.) that arc sold at retail or used as promotional or premium items. Player retains the right to grant permission to a licensee to utilize his image if that licensee is not concurrently utilizing the images of five (5) or more other NFL player on products that are sold at retail or are used as promotional or premium items. If Players inclusion in a particular NFLPA program is precluded by an individual exclusive endorsement agreement, and Player provides the NFLPA with timely written notice of that preclusion, the NFLPA will exclude Player from that particular program. In consideration for this assignment of rights, the NFLPA will use the revenues it receives from group licensing programs to support the objectives as set forth in the By-laws of the NFLPA. The NFLPA will use its best efforts to promote the use of NFL player images in group licensing programs, to provide group licensing opportunities to all NFL players, and to ensure that no entity utilizes the group licensing rights granted to the NFLPA without first obtaining a license from the NFLPA. This subparagraph (b) shall be construed under Virginia law without reference to conflicts of law principles. The assignment in this paragraph shall expire on December 31 of the later of (a) the third year following the execution of this contract, or (b) the year in which this contract expires. Neither Club nor the League is a party to the terms of this paragraph, which is included herein solely for the administrative convenience and benefit of Player and the NFLPA. The terms of this subparagraph apply unless, at the time of execution of this contract, Player indicates by striking out this subparagraph (b) and marking his initials adjacent to the stricken language his intention not to participate in the NFLPA Group Licensing Program. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to supersede or any way broaden, expand, detract from, or otherwise alter in any way whatsoever, the rights of NFL Properties, Inc. as permitted under Article V (Union Security), Section 4 of the 1993 Collective Bargaining Agreement. 5. COMPENSATION. For performance of Players services and all other promises of Player, Club will pay Player a yearly salary as follows: $5,000,000 for the 2012 season;

$5,250,000 for the 2013 season; $5,750,000 for the 2014 season; $6,000,000 for the 2015 season; $6,500,000 for the 2016 season. In addition, Club will pay Player such earned performance bonuses as may be called for in this contract; Players necessary traveling expenses from his residence to training camp; Players reasonable board and lodging expenses during pre-season training and in connection with playing pre-season, regular season, and post-season football games outside Clubs home city; Players necessary traveling expenses to and from pre-season, regular season, and post-season football games outside Clubs home city; Players necessary traveling expenses to his residence if this contract is terminated by Club; and such additional compensation, benefits, and reimbursement of expenses as may be called for in any collective bargaining agreement in existence during the term of this contract. (For purposes of this contract, a collective bargaining agreement will be deemed to be in existence during its stated term or during any period for which the parties to that agreement agree to extend it.) 6. PAYMENT. Unless this contract or any collective bargaining agreement in existence during the term of this contract specifically provides otherwise, Player will be paid 100% of his yearly salary under this contract in equal weekly or bi-weekly installments over the course of the applicable regular season period, commencing with the first regular season game played by Club in each season. Unless this contract specifically provides otherwise, if this contract is executed or Player is activated after the beginning of the regular season, the yearly salary payable to Player will be reduced proportionately and Player will be paid the weekly or bi-weekly portions of his yearly salary becoming due and payable after he is activated. Unless this contract specifically provides otherwise, if this contract is terminated after the beginning of the regular season, the yearly salary payable to Player will be reduced proportionately and Player will be paid the weekly or bi-weekly portions of his yearly salary having become due and payable up to the time of termination. 7. DEDUCTIONS. Any advance made to Player will be repaid to Club, and any properly levied Club fine or Commissioner fine against Player will be paid, in cash on demand or by means of deductions from payments coming due to the Player under this contract, the amount of such deductions to be determined by Club unless this contract or any collective bargaining agreement in existence during the term of this contract specifically provides otherwise. 8. PHYSICAL CONDITION. Player represents to Club that he is and will maintain himself in excellent physical condition. Player will undergo a complete physical examination by the Club physician upon Club request, during which physical examination Player agrees to make full and complete disclosure of any physical or mental condition known to him which might impair his performance under this contract and to respond fully and in good faith when questioned by the Club physician about such condition. If Player fails to establish or maintain his excellent physical condition to the satisfaction of the Club physician, or make the required full and complete disclosure and good faith responses to the Club physician, then Club may terminate this contract. 9. INJURY. Unless this contract specifically provides otherwise, if Player is injured in the performance of his services under this contract and promptly reports such injury to the Club physician or trainer, then Player will receive such medical and hospital care during the term of this contract as the Club physician may deem necessary, and will continue to receive his yearly salary for so long, during the season of injury only and for no subsequent period covered by this contract, as Player is physically unable to perform the services required of him by this contract because of such injury. If Players injury in the performance of his services under this contract results in his death, the unpaid balance of his yearly salary for the season of injury will be paid to his stated beneficiary, or in the absence of a stated beneficiary, to his estate. 10. WORKERS COMPENSATION. Any compensation paid to Player under this contract or under any collective bargaining agreement in existence during the term of this contract for a period during which he is entitled to workers compensation benefits by reason of temporary total, permanent total, temporary partial, or permanent partial disability will be deemed an advance payment of workers compensation benefits due Player, and Club will be entitled to be reimbursed the amount of such payment out of any award of workers compensation. 11. SKILL, PERFORMANCE AND CONDUCT. Player understands that he is competing with other players for a position on Clubs roster within the applicable player limits. If at any time, in the sole judgement of Club, Players skill or performance has been unsatisfactory as compared with that of other players competing for positions on Clubs roster, or if Player has engaged in personal conduct reasonably judged by Club to adversely affect or reflect on Club, then Club may terminate this contract. In addition, during the period any salary cap is legally in effect, this contract may be terminated if, in Clubs opinion, Player is anticipated to make less of a contribution to Clubs ability to compete on the playing field than another player or players who Club intends to sign or attempts to sign, or another player or players who is or are already on Clubs roster, and for whom Club needs room. 12. TERMINATION. The rights of termination set forth in this contract will be in addition to any other rights of termination allowed either party by law. Termination will be effective upon the giving of written notice, except that Players death, other than as a result of injury incurred in the performance of his services under this contract, will automatically terminate this contract. If this contract is terminated by Club and either Player or Club so requests, Player will promptly undergo a complete physical examination by the Club physician. 13. INJURY GRIEVANCE. Unless a collective bargaining agreement in existence at the time of termination of this contract by Club provides otherwise, the following injury grievance procedure will apply: If Player believes that at the time of termination of this contract by

Club he was physically unable to perform the services required of him by this contract because of an injury incurred in the performance of his services under this contract, Player may, within 60 days after examination by the Club physician, submit at his own expense to examination by a physician of his choice. If the opinion of Players physician with respect to his physical ability to perform the services required of him by this contract is contrary to that of the Clubs physician, the dispute will be submitted within a reasonable time to final and binding arbitration by an arbitrator selected by Club and Player or, if they are unable to agree, one selected in accordance with the procedures of the American Arbitration Association on application by either party. 14. RULES. Player will comply with and be bound by all reasonable Club rules and regulations in effect during the term of this contract which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this contract or of any collective bargaining agreement in existence during the term of this contract. Players attention is also called to the fact that the League functions with certain rules and procedures expressive of its operation as a joint venture among its member clubs and that these rules and practices may affect Players relationship to the League and its member clubs independently of the provisions of this contract. 15. INTEGRITY OF GAME. Player recognizes the detriment to the League and professional football that would result from impairment of public confidence in the honest and orderly conduct of NFL games or the integrity and good character of NFL players. Player therefore acknowledges his awareness that if he accepts a bribe or agrees to throw or fix an NFL game; fails to promptly report a bribe offer or an attempt to throw or fix an NFL game; bets on an NFL game; knowingly associates with gamblers or gambling activity; uses or provides other players with stimulants or other drugs for the purpose of attempting to enhance on-field performance; or is guilty of any other form of conduct reasonably judged by the League Commissioner to be detrimental to the League or professional football, the Commissioner will have the right, but only after giving Player the opportunity for a hearing at which he may be represented by counsel of his choice, to fine Player in a reasonable amount; to suspend Player for a period certain or indefinitely; and/or to terminate this contract. 16. EXTENSION. Unless this contract specifically provides otherwise, if Player becomes a member of the Armed Forces of the United States or any other country, or retires from professional football as an active player, or otherwise fails or refuses to perform his services under this contract, then this contract will be tolled between the date of Players induction into the Armed Forces, or his retirement, or his failure or refusal to perform, and the later date of his return to professional football. During the period this contract is tolled, Player will not be entitled to any compensation or benefits. On Players return to professional football, the term of this contract will be extended for a period of time equal to the number of seasons (to the nearest multiple of one) remaining at the time the contract was tolled. The right of renewal, if any, contained in this contract will remain in effect until the end of any such extended term. 17. ASSIGNMENT. Unless this contract specifically provides otherwise, Club may assign this contract and Players services under this contract to any successor to Clubs franchise or to any other Club in the League. Player will report to the assignee Club promptly upon being informed of the assignment of his contract and will faithfully perform his services under this contract. The assignee club will pay Players necessary traveling expenses in reporting to it and will faithfully perform this contract with Player. 18. FILING. This contract will be valid and binding upon Player and Club immediately upon execution. A copy of this contract, including any attachment to it, will be filed by Club with the League Commissioner within 10 days after execution. The Commissioner will have the right to disapprove this contract on reasonable grounds, including but not limited to an attempt by the parties to abridge or impair the rights of any other club, uncertainty or incompleteness in expression of the parties respective rights and obligations, or conflict between the terms of this contract and any collective bargaining agreement then in existence. Approval will be automatic unless, within 10 days after receipt of this contract in his office, the Commissioner notifies the parties either of disapproval or of extension of this 10-day period for purposes of investigation or clarification pending his decision. On the receipt of notice of disapproval and termination, both parties will be relieved of their respective rights and obligations under this contract. 19. DISPUTES. During the term of any collective bargaining agreement, any dispute between Player and Club involving the interpretation or application of any provision of this contract will be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the procedure called for in any collective bargaining agreement in existence at the time the event giving rise to any such dispute occurs. 20. NOTICE. Any notice, request, approval or consent under this contract will be sufficiently given if in writing and delivered in person or mailed (certified or first class) by one party to the other at the address set forth in this contract or to such other address as the recipient may subsequently have furnished in writing to the sender. 21. OTHER AGREEMENTS. This contract, including any attachment to it, sets forth the entire agreement between Player and Club and cannot be modified or supplemented orally. Player and Club represent that no other agreement, oral or written, except as attached to or specifically incorporated in this contract, exists between them. The provisions of this contract will govern the relationship between Player and Club unless there are conflicting provisions in any collective bargaining agreement in existence during the term of this contract, in which case the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement will take precedence over conflicting provisions of this contract relating to the rights or obligations of either party. 22. LAW. This contract is made under and shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas. 23. WAIVER AND RELEASE. Player waives and releases any claims that he may have arising out of, related to, or asserted in the lawsuit entitled White v. National Football League , including, but not limited to, any such claim regarding past NFL Rules, the College Draft, Plan B, the first refusal/compensation system, the NFL Player Contract, pre-season compensation, or any other term or condition of employment,

This waiver and release also extends to any conduct engaged in pursuant to the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement in White (Settlement Agreement) during the express term of that Settlement Agreement or any portion thereof.

Despite any contrary language in this Contract, Club agrees that for the 2012 League Year only, Club will pay Player Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) of the Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) salary provided in Paragraph 5, despite the fact that Players Contract is terminated via the NFL waiver system (i) because, in Clubs sole judgment, Players skill or performance has been unsatisfactory as compared with that of other players competing for positions on Clubs roster; and/or (ii) if due to a NFL football related injury or death suffered while performing services pursuant to the Contract, Player is unable, in the sole discretion of Clubs physician, to pass Clubs preseason physical examination for the 2012 League Year as a result of such injury and/or (iii) due to Clubs determination to create room for Salary Cap purposes (in any year in which a salary cap is in effect). The 2012 Guarantee by Club will not apply in any year after 2012, regardless of whether Player is, as of this date, under contract or option to Club for a subsequent year, and regardless of whether Player passes Clubs physical examination for a year subsequent to 2012. Player shall be in default of his obligations under this Paragraph if in the 2012 League Year (a) Player, without the prior written consent of Clubs Head Coach or General Manager, fails or refuses to report to Club or fails to practice with or play for Club or leaves Club for any reason whatsoever (other than Players injury (or death resulting therefrom) suffered while performing services under the Contract), including, but not limited to, (i) Players retirement; (ii) Players incarceration; (iii) Players injury or disability resulting from his breach of Paragraph 3 of the Contract or as a result of his participating in hazardous activities which involve a significant risk of personal injury and are non-football in nature, including, without limitation, water or snow skiing, surfing, hang gliding, bungee jumping, scuba diving, sky diving, rock or mountain climbing, race car driving as driver or passenger, riding a motorcycle, motor bike, all-terrain or similar vehicle as driver or passenger, travel on or flight in any test or experimental aircraft, or serving as a pilot or crew member on any flight; and (iv) Players suspension by the NFL or Club for Conduct Detrimental or for violating any of the NFLs disciplinary policies or programs, specifically including the NFL Personal Conduct Policy but specifically excluding the NFL Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse and the NFL Policy on Anabolic Steroids and Related Substances, or (b) Player materially breaches any provision of this Contract, including, without limitation, any representation and warranty. In the event Player is in default hereunder, then the 2012 Guarantee shall immediately be deemed null and void from the beginning and in its entirety regardless of whether or not the 2012 Guarantee had otherwise been earned according to its terms at the time of Players default, and Club shall be relieved of the obligation to guarantee such forfeited proportionate amount. In the event of any such default, Player will be entitled to earn the specified Paragraph 5 Salary on a non-guaranteed basis, subject to any applicable fines and/or forfeitures. This 2012 Guarantee is for the 2012 League Year only and in no way supersedes or obviates the applicability of the Leagues waiver system to Player nor does it provide Player a guaranteed spot on the Clubs roster.
