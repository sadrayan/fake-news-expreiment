Health insurance co-op for Iowa, Nebraska launched
Health care cooperatives that are being launched in eight states, including Iowa, announced Tuesday they will receive a total of $638 million in loans from the Obama administration under the federal health insurance law.

Health care cooperatives that are being launched in eight states, including Iowa, announced Tuesday they will receive a total of $638 million in loans from the Obama administration under the federal health insurance law.

The administration said the new nonprofit health insurers will be run by their customers, and will be designed to offer coverage to individuals and small businesses. Supporters say the co-ops will keep pressure on private insurance companies for both price and coverage.

Critics, led by House Republicans who voted last year to repeal the health care law, immediately questioned the administration�s decision. The House Ways and Means Committee called the loans a political reward to a friendly constituency.

The administration said they determined the organizations getting the money are able to deliver the required services.

Starting in 2014, millions of people who are currently uninsured will buy private coverage in new state markets under President Barack Obama�s health care reform law. Tax-credit subsidies will help customers with the cost of the insurance.

The co-ops will compete in these state-run insurance exchanges, although co-op backers said they do not yet know the cost of premiums when the program will be formally unveiled in late 2013. Initially, they expect to compete for a small share of the overall health insurance market.

A new company in Iowa and Nebraska has secured a $112.6 million federal loan to create a nonprofit, consumer-governed health insurance company to sell policies to individuals and businesses in both states.

Issued as part of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the loan will help the two states create the company in time for Jan. 1, 2014, the nationwide launch date for the the bulk of the provisions of the national health care bill.

A pair of Ames residents played key roles in helping the entity, currently called Midwest Members Health, secure the first round of federal money.

Dr. David Carlyle, a family physician at McFarland Clinic, has served since June 2010 on a citizen advisory board that advised the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on how to set up the cooperatives.

Carlyle, who so far has worked only as an adviser and observer with the new entity, said he wants to work with groups of this kind �because they are committed to involving consumers in using the health care system more effectively to improve their health.�

Stephen Ringlee, managing director of Centesimus Capital in Ames, will be one of three members of a �formation board of directors� that will oversee the creation of the Iowa-Nebraska nonprofit insurance company.

He will be joined by David Lyons, former Iowa Insurance Commissioner and CEO of the Iowa Institute, and Cliff Gold, former executive with Wellmark Blue Shield of Iowa.

�This organization will transition to a member-owned entity that will create the (insurance company),� Ringlee said.

Besides Iowa and Nebraska, the new federal awards were announced for co-ops serving Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Wisconsin.

Money from the loans will be given to the co-ops over time as they meet benchmarks.

The federal government said it will be rolling out awards to co-ops in other states as more applications are processed.
