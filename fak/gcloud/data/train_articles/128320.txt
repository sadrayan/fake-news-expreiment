Inside Paris, all of them are being or have already been rehabilitated, either by political action or by the "washer" phenomenon which sees upper middle class people moving to surrounding areas in search of decent housing prices.

For the worst of themn, alas, no, and the last 4 years of government have been very dire years for urban action. As an example, many of these zones don't have any more police stations, instead, they are crammed with riot police when the tension is high.

The much unfamed Clichy sous Bois never had a police station, nor an ANPE (employment administration). La Courneuve, where a killing triggered Sarkozy's (Interior Minister) "KÃ¤rcher" words, has seen its police forces decrease by 70 since 2002.

I could go on and on, but I'm afraid it'd be too political for TA.
