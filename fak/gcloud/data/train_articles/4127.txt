Trump Is Sure Hillary 'Used Chemicals' To Delete Her Emails
This week much has been made of the fact that when Hillary Clinton's server disks were wiped, they used a product called Bleach Bit to perform a secure wipe. This is a protocol all users should employ, by the way, so that remnants of private information do not remain on hardware which is being retired or reused by someone else.

Bleach Bit is an open source program intended to protect users' privacy. It is software.

Someone should inform Donald Trump of that fact, because this is what he told his audience in Everett, Washington Tuesday night.

"33,000 emails that she deleted," he fumed. "They're gone!"

It was actually her lawyers that deleted them, but let's not dwell on facts.

"Not only deleted, folks. This was after she she was subpoenaed by Congress," he droned on.

"And not only that, she BLEACHED which somebody said they'd never even heard of," Trump blithered. "In a very expensive fashion, used chemicals so that nobody will ever be able to see them."

Oh, good Lord. Was there no techie in all of Washington State, home to Microsoft, who could have explained that good disk hygiene includes using a comprehensive drive wiper?

No, no. She BLEACHED HER EMAILS. Holy cow, what an evil crone.
