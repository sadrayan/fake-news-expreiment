Statement by Senator Stone on the slaying of Whittier Police Officer
(Sacramento, CA) – Senator Jeff Stone (R-28th District) released the following statement on the senseless killing of Whittier Police Officer Keith Boyer:

“The tragic and senseless killing of veteran Whittier Police Officer Keith Boyer by a criminal felon recently released from incarceration appears to be another example of the danger created by the passage of misleading Propositions and bad Legislation that have allowed dangerous criminals back onto the streets of California.

On Monday I watched as Whittier Police Chief Jeff Piper said, ‘We need to wake up. Enough is enough. You’re passing these propositions; you’re creating these laws that are raising crime.’

Chief Piper is exactly right and reflects the frustration I’ve heard from many in law enforcement from across California.

Since the passage of Proposition 47 by voters in 2014 and the signing of AB 109 in 2011, violent crime has been on the rise in California, up 12 percent in 2015 statewide according to the FBI.

The passage of Proposition 57 last November will only make these problems worse.

I will continue to stand up here in Sacramento against laws that allow dangerous criminal to be released onto our streets.

I also send my condolences to the family of Officer Boyer and my hopes for a swift recovery to Officer Patrick Hazel who was wounded in this brazen attack by a paroled felon who should have never been allowed to go free.”
