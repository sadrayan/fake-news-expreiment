Since President Obama Released His Birth Certificate, Will Donald Trump Release His Tax Returns? (UPDATE)
So will Donald Trump release his tax returns now?

President Obama released the long form birth certificate that Trump was calling for. And Trump took credit for it when he landed for his first visit to New Hampshire this morning.

“Today I’m very proud of myself because I’ve accomplished something nobody else has been able to accomplish. I was just informed while on the helicopter that our president has finally released a birth certificate,” Trump said. “I want to look at it, but I hope it’s true so that we can get on with much more important matters, so the press can stop asking me questions. He should have done it a long time ago.”

But Obama releasing his long form birth certificate does put the ball back in his court. Remember when I asked Trump in my interview last week if he would release his tax returns? This is what he said:

“Maybe I’m going to do the tax returns when Obama does his birth certificate. I may tie my tax returns,” Trump told me. “I’d love to give my tax returns. I may tie my tax returns into Obama’s birth certificate.”

So what do you think? Will Trump do it?

UPDATE: My colleague Michael Falcone caught up with Trump in New Hampshire and asked him if he would follow through and release his tax returns.

“That’s something I would be thinking about doing anyway. That is certainly something I’d be thinking about doing anyway. But before I do anything I have to make the decision in June and the first thing I’m going to be releasing will be financials,” Trump said.

Falcone asked again, will you fulfill that pledge that you made where you said I’m going to tie the birth certificate to my tax records?

“Yeah, at the appropriate time,” Trump responded.

“So you’ll do it?”

“Yeah, at the appropriate time I’m going to do it,” Trump told him.
