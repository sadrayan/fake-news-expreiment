Two months after her election loss, Hillary Clinton plans to be in the crowd for the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.

An aide to the Democratic nominee confirmed Tuesday that she and former president Bill Clinton will attend this month's ceremony, speaking on condition of anonymity until plans are announced publicly.

It will be the first joint public appearance by Trump and Hillary Clinton since the three presidential debates that preceded Trump's surprise election victory.

Bill Clinton will be one at least three ex-presidents at the Jan. 20 inauguration of Trump; George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter have also announced plans to attend.

Bush and former first lady Laura Bush "are pleased to be able to witness the peaceful transfer of power â€” a hallmark of American democracy," spokesman Freddy Ford said Tuesday.

Former president George H.W. Bush is not expected to attend because of health reasons.

As is tradition, current President Obama will also be at the inauguration of his successor.
