Claims that Clint Eastwood is donating a Northern California ranch and other assets to President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election campaign are false, according to representatives of the actor.

False reports circulating on social media claim Eastwood's donations include 40,000 acres of Nevada grazing land and $7 million in cash. The sites say the campaign will use the ranch as a Pacific Northwest command center "far from the prying eyes of Obama and the deep state."

Daily World Update, a self-dubbed satirical site, is among the sites making the claim. In an April 27 story, it quotes the actor as saying his doctors have urged him to get his affairs in order and that he'll be fortunate to still be around next year. The false story claims the actor says he's taken financial care of his family and wants his personal estate to go to something bigger.

The claims are "false in every respect," attorney Kevin Marks wrote in an email to The Associated Press.
