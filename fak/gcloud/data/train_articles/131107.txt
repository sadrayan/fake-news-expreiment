BREAKING: New Details Shine A Sad Light On Bill O’Reilly’s Death – Am…
Bill O’Reilly, found dead at his home on Long Island last night, took his own life, according to the Islip Coroner’s Office. LLOD reporter Skip Tetheluda was onsite this morning when the family asked the coroner not to hold a press conference so they could maintain some privacy during this difficult time.

Tetheluda told us by phone:

“Bill O’Reilly was looking at spending the rest of his life surrounded by mounting allegations that he was a filthy old scumbag who couldn’t keep his hands to himself. He decided not to try living with the embarrassment and instead blew the back of his head off with a .45 caliber handgun he kept in his desk. A note on scene wasn’t read out loud but this reporter heard mention of an apology to his wife and daughter and concern that they would always see him as the monster that he was.”

O’Reilly’s family isn’t commenting. Investigators are still searching and logging the scene and say that while the obvious may be what they are looking at. They won’t rule out foul play with such a high-profile victim. For now, though, it seems like Bill O’Reilly’s own demons are what did him in.
