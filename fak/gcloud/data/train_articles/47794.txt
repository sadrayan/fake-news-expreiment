After Sandy Hook, More Than 400 People Have Been Shot in Over 200 School Shootings
When a gunman killed 20 first graders and six adults with an assault rifle at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, it rattled Newtown, Conn., and reverberated across the world. Since then, there have been at least 239 school shootings nationwide. In those episodes, 438 people were shot, 138 of whom were killed.

The data used here is from the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that began tracking school shootings in 2014, about a year after Sandy Hook.

Note: Shootings in 2013 are not included because complete data was not available in that year. Months with blanks indicate no shootings archived.

The shootings have taken place at sporting events and in parking lots, cafeterias, hallways and classrooms.

A shooting took place Wednesday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., about an hour northwest of Miami. As of Wednesday night, 17 people had been killed and the number of people injured was unknown.

Sixteen of the 239 shootings shown below can be classified as mass shootings, events in which four or more people are shot.

On average, there have been about five school shootings each month, including episodes that were not mass shootings.

Each of the episodes falls under the definition of “school shooting” used by the Gun Violence Archive.

The nonprofit defines a school shooting as an episode on the property of an elementary school, secondary school or college campus. Another defining characteristic is timing — shootings must occur during school hours or during extracurricular activities.

Only episodes in which people were injured or killed by gunfire are included. Injuries like a leg broken while fleeing the site were not archived.

Police reports often leave out the origin of guns used in school shootings, but researchers say a significant portion of the guns used in such episodes come from the shooters’ homes.

Many children have access to unlocked guns at home. Data from gun ownership surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center show that 54 percent of gun owners with children under 18 living at home say they keep all of their guns locked away.

Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., have laws that impose criminal liability on those who store guns at home and know “or reasonably should know” that those firearms are accessible to children.
