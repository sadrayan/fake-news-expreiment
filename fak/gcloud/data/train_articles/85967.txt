GOP governors group out with Buono attack ad
TRENTON — The Republican Governors Association this morning made its first foray into the New Jersey race with an attack ad against state Sen. Barbara Buono.

Much like Gov. Chris Christie's negative ads to date, the 30-second television commercial links his likely Democratic opponent to former Gov. Jon Corzine, offering identical numbers.

“After failing to recruit any of their top choices to run, Democrats are now stuck with Barbara Buono’s record of voting to raise taxes 154 times while overseeing out-of-control spending,” RGA spokeswoman Gail Gitcho said in a statement.

The RGA, where Christie was vice chairman last year, spent $7.5 million on his 2009 race against Corzine.

The Democratic Governors Association has yet to air any ads on Buono's behalf. The DGA and the Buono campaign today declined to say if there are plans to do so.

"Governor Christie and his national Republican sponsors' false attacks on Senator Buono's record are attempts to distract from the truth: they have made careers off defending millionaires over working and middle class families," said Buono campaign spokesman David Turner.
