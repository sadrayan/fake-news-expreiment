Opinion | The Slaves in Georgetown’s Past
Taking a name off a building or a family crest off a seal is a meaningless gesture with no long-term effect, and I simply do not understand why administrators and students don’t see that.

Well done, Georgetown. And kudos to the alumnus who is helping you. You are modeling a sophisticated response to a difficult but long-overdue challenge — a response that reveals the seriousness with which you are accepting the challenge by being the embodiment of what universities do.

To the Editor:

So much about the story of Georgetown University and slavery merits reflection. It exemplifies slavery’s centrality in American history, but also reveals the transitory nature of historical memory.

As a Georgetown student in the mid-1970s, I learned of the university’s slave past in a course on Jesuit studies that included a trip to the plantations in southern Maryland. Professors in the history department spoke openly about slavery’s role in sustaining the university.

Apparently that part of the university’s past fell out of consciousness, but now (laudably) is rediscovered and explored by current students at Georgetown. But on the other side of the country in California, my students at Sonoma State University have long known about the Maryland Jesuits and slavery.

Thanks to the Jesuit Plantation Project, a digitized collection mounted by Georgetown’s American Studies Program 20 years ago, my students used the online documents to learn how to do historical research.
