Pew Interactive: Home Visiting
The interactive below summarizes key details about the 119 home visiting programs that states reported funding in fiscal year 2010. (See how Pew defined home visiting in its survey.)

All together, 46 states made about $1.4 billion available for early childhood home visiting, but only $462 million was budgeted exclusively for that purpose. The remaining $912 million could have been spent on home visiting or other services, depending on decisions by local leaders. In several cases, states were unable to confirm how much, if any, of these funds ultimately supported home visiting.
