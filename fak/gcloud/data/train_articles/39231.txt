Improving Timely Linkage to Lifesaving Treatment

Frank, a community health worker (CHW) with the Tingathe program, explains the results of a HIV test to a couple expecting their first child. In partnership with staff from the Malawi Ministry of Health who coordinate antenatal services, Frank and his colleagues offer HIV testing and counseling to pregnant women and their husbands here at Kawale Health Center in Lilongwe, Malawi. By identifying and offering HIV testing and counseling to women early in their pregnancy, Tingathe CHWs drive timely diagnosis and initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART).
