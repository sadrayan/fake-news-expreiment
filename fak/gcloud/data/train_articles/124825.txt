Stop dumping oil and gas wastewater in California
We Californians think of ourselves as environmental leaders, but when it comes to protecting our health and environment from the oil and gas industry, our state comes up short. The pollution from dumping oil and gas wastewater into unlined and open air pits is just one example of our how our state’s inadequate laws, regulations and enforcement have led to harm. This practice must end.

For decades, oil producers were allowed to dump their wastewater wherever they wanted, with little concern for health or environmental protection.

The absence of water-quality laws turned many oil-producing areas of California into dumping grounds for billions of gallons of toxic wastewater, laced with heavy metals, salts and carcinogens. Nobody knows how many thousands of waste pits have been used since oil production began in the 1860s.

With the passage of modern water and air-quality protections, open pits should have been ruled out. This method of disposal intentionally puts harmful chemicals into the environment. But it is the cheapest way to get rid of this enormous waste stream, so oil companies keep doing it.

Although state regulators have begun to limit this practice, and other disposal methods have become more widespread, wastewater is still dumped into more than 1,110 pits — and water laws are often ignored. My organization found that 60 percent of the 790 active pits in California either don’t have a permit or the permit is out of date.

Unlined pits have led to contamination of water, soil and air, the extent of which is still unknown. One almond farmer in western Kern County lost his farm after unlined pits contaminated his groundwater. At another Kern County facility, wastewater has migrated more than a mile underground. Testing at that same site shows elevated levels of smog-forming and health-harming air emissions. Another facility has discharged toxic chemicals into an aquifer that supplies water to neighboring homes and farms.

The long-term effects of this pollution are still unknown. It can take years or even decades for contamination to move through groundwater, so the extent of the damage will only reveal itself over time.

Californians know better than to gamble with our water future. It’s time for California to join other states that have prohibited unlined pit disposal, such as Colorado, Texas and Pennsylvania. Our drought-ravaged state should protect the little water we have left.

Science agrees. The California Council on Science & Technology, an independent panel of scientists, came to the conclusion in a 2015 assessment that, “If the presence of hazardous concentrations of chemicals cannot be ruled out, (agencies) should phase out the practice of discharging produced water into percolation pits.” In response, state Sen. Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills (Los Angeles County) introduced SB248, which would phase out disposal pits. The bill stalled temporarily in the Assembly last year after industry lobbying derailed it.

Now regulators have a chance to do the right thing. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board is developing rules to oversee pits more effectively, and could prohibit them. If the board does not, then the Legislature must end this polluting practice. Tell our water regulators this is a priority for the future of the state.
