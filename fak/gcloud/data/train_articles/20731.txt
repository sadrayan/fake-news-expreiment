No specific threat to oust Duterte — military
MANILA, Philippines — The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) said Monday they have not monitored any specific threat to unseat President Rodrigo Duterte.

AFP public affairs chief Col. Noel Detoyato said that while that ouster plots may always be a part of a presidency, he said the President continues to have “a very strong support” from Filipinos and destabilization plots will not likely succeed.

“Maraming nagka-come up na information pero (There were information coming in but) no specific threat because we have a very strong AFP, we have a very strong PNP (Philippine National Police), and very strong support na nakikita namin coming from the Filipinos sa ating administration (that we see coming from Filipinos and the administration),” he told reporters.

“There may be some individuals who are thinking of ousting the President, but it will never, never materialize,” he added.

The statement was issued in response to a front-page report of Manila Times that there is a supposed plot to destabilize the administration.

The matrix has linked media organizations and journalists to the efforts to discredit the President. /ee
