What are the recent and forecasted trends in prescription drug spending?
For much of the past two decades – with the exception of the period surrounding the economic downturn – growth in utilization outpaced growth in pharmaceutical prices. Due to the way drugs are selected for inclusion in the price index, it can take some time for new drugs to be incorporated into the index. The price index for drugs has held relatively stable since the mid-1990s (ranging in growth from about 1% to 5% annually), while the utilization index has changed more over time.
