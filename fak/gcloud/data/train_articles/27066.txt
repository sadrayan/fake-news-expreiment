Today’s mass shooter was a member of the Resistance who referred to Trump supporters as “trumptards,” a review of his reddit history reveals. — Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) August 27, 2018

David Katz’s Reddit page is littered with anti-Trump garbage.

Via Ian Miles Cheong:



Katz called Trump supporters “Trumptards” and said they were mentally challenged.

Then he shot up a video bar.

I think we all know the answer to that.
