WisPolitics.com: Rep. Pope: Response to Speaker Vos misleading statements
4/5/2013Contact: Rep. Sondy Pope608-266-3520(MADISON) Representative Sondy Pope today released the following statement regarding the Speakers Briefing from Rep. Vos.Saying that one in four public schools is receiving a subpar score on the school report cards is a gross misrepresentation of the truth. It is also disappointing that Speaker Vos has highlighted a graduation rate for voucher students (94%) that relies on data for only 44% of the total study participants. Assuming that the lost 56% all graduated from high school is a leap of faith I do not think anyone should be willing to make. If we are going to have an honest discussion about increasing the performance of all types of Wisconsin schools, we cannot continue to tolerate this type of intellectual dishonesty.Under the current report card format, 14% of schools fit into the bottom two categories of performance: 4% fail to meet expectations and 10% meet few expectations.
