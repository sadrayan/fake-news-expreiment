Join the Cascadia Rising 2016 exercise TweetChat June 6 with #CascadiaEQ
On June 6 at 12 p.m. PT, a one-hour Q&A TweetChat will take place about a possible 9.0 magnitude Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. The theme is “We’re preparing, and so can you.” ShakeOut will host the chat, which will be supported by scientists and preparedness subject matter experts.

The chat will take place one day before Cascadia Rising 2016, the large scale simulation exercise June 7-10 where emergency managers across the region will train and test the whole community approach to complex disaster operations together as a team.

To participate, follow the hashtag #CascadiaEQ on Twitter. In addition to the TweetChat, FEMA Region 10 will be using that hashtag during the exercise. For questions about preparedness or the subduction zone, FEMA welcomes the public’s participation.
