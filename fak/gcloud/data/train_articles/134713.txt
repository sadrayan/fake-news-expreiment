An article published by Classic 105 claiming that Elizabeth Bwalya Mwewa, a former nurse at the Zambia University Teaching Hospital confessed to switching 5,000 newborns while working at the hospital between 1983 and 1995 is FALSE.

The article, which originally appeared on The Zambian Observer, claimed that Mwewa is battling terminal cancer and made the confession from a hospital bed.

A reverse image search also shows that the photo used in the article was first posted on Ma Sedaye, a website by a Zimbabwean nurse living in Columbus, Ohio.

In a press statement sent to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the General Nursing Council of Zambia (GNCZ) denied the claim, adding that the nurse in question did not exist on the GNCZ register nor work in the University Teaching Hospital maternity ward.
