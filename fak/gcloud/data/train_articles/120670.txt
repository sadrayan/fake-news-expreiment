28 March 2018

All sectoral determinations paying below the R20.00 per hour as proposed by National Minimum Wage (NMW) will cease in terms of wages when the latter comes into law, a meeting was told at Richards Bay, KwaZulu–Natal today.

Stephen Rathai: Director of Employment Standards in the Department of labour, was addressing employers at Umhlathuze Municipality offices during the NMW briefing session focusing on the NMW Bill exemptions.

‘’The NMW is serious about poverty alleviation and inequality reduction,‘’ he said

At the same time Rathai urged industries paying below the proposed NMW to ‘’ up their game’’

The NMW has proposed that Farming and Forestry should pay R18.00 per hour, Domestic sector R15.00 per hour and expanded public works programme R11.00 an hour.

Earlier, Kekulu Pali from Employment Standards told the audience that exemptions will be granted if the delegated authority is satisfied that “ the employer cannot afford to pay the minimum wage - every representative trade union has been meaningfully consulted and must provide the bargaining council, union or affected workers with a copy of the application”.
