Known for her revealing onstage outfits and diva-like performances, Rihanna cut a far smarter figure at the conference, comfortably mingling with politicians and Senegalese dignitaries alike.

This is not the first time the pair have met - Macron hosted Rihanna at his presidential palace last year after she challenged him on Twitter to contribute to her efforts to fund education in developing countries, notably in conflict and crisis areas.

The singer, whose The Clara Lionel Foundation promotes education and arts globally, also urged other Western leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, to contribute at Friday's conference, as funding promises poured.

During the conference Macron called education 'the only single response' to the extremism and fundamentalism threatening the West Africa region.

He promised 200 million euros for the fund, sharply upping France's earlier offer, and urged others to pitch in toward the 3.1 billion euro overall goal.

Macron, who has visited 17 countries since he was inaugurated in May, also met privately with Senegalese President Macky Sall and opened a school.

Ahead of the conference, Macron met Sall at the presidential palace in the Senegalese capital and signed agreements on the sale of two Airbus planes for 171 million euros and the creation of a Franco-Senegalese university campus.

Senegalese police made several arrests on Friday afternoon when dispersing a protest march by 'France Degage', a group which wants the former colonial power to reduce its role in Senegal.

Macron has visited Africa six times already in his nine months as president, spending time in several former French colonies and reaffirming support for the Barkhane counter-terror force rooting out jihadists across the Sahel region.

Macron, travelling with his wife, Brigitte, then visited French forces serving with the G5 Sahel, a five-nation regional force launched last year to counter growing extremism in West Africa.

Brigitte meanwhile already met Angelina Jolie in Paris earlier in the week as the Hollywood star discussed a recent trip to Jordan and urged members of the UN Security Council to resolve the conflict in Syria.

The American actress and humanitarian wore a demure off-white dress under a grey shawl as she made her way through the streets of the French capital to meet with President Emmanuel Macron's wife at the Élysée Palace.

Shielding her eyes behind a pair of oversized sunglasses, UNHCR Special Envoy Angelina also made a stop at the Guerlain boutique on the Champs-Elysées, where she is believed to have posed for an ad campaign.
