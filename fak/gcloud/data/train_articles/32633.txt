Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: A system that allows billionaires to exist alongside extreme poverty is immoral
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez delivers a speech during the Women's March in Columbus Circle in New York, United States on January 19, 2019.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez agrees that "a system that allows billionaires to exist" is immoral.

The freshman congresswoman responded affirmatively to a question on the subject at an event celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday in New York, just as many of the world's billionaires were gathering for the start of the annual Davos economic confab in Switzerland amid concerns over economic uncertainty and rising populism.

"I don't think that necessarily means that all billionaires are immoral," she qualified, citing Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, both major philanthropists. Gates is expected to attend Davos again this year.

Still, she said it is "wrong" that billionaires can coexist in a country alongside "parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don't have access to public health."

At MLK Now, an event at Riverside Church in New York City's Harlem neighborhood, Ocasio-Cortez spoke out against economic inequality in a conversation with journalist and author Ta-Nehisi Coates.
