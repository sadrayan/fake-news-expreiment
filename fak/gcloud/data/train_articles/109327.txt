A structural explanation for the low effectiveness of the seasonal influenza H3N2 vaccine
The effectiveness of the annual influenza vaccine has declined in recent years, especially for the H3N2 component, and is a concern for global public health. A major cause for this lack in effectiveness has been attributed to the egg-based vaccine production process. Substitutions on the hemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) often arise during virus passaging that change its antigenicity and hence vaccine effectiveness. Here, we characterize the effect of a prevalent substitution, L194P, in egg-passaged H3N2 viruses. X-ray structural analysis reveals that this substitution surprisingly increases the mobility of the 190-helix and neighboring regions in antigenic site B, which forms one side of the receptor binding site (RBS) and is immunodominant in recent human H3N2 viruses. Importantly, the L194P substitution decreases binding and neutralization by an RBS-targeted broadly neutralizing antibody by three orders of magnitude and significantly changes the HA antigenicity as measured by binding of human serum antibodies. The receptor binding mode and specificity are also altered to adapt to avian receptors during egg passaging. Overall, these findings help explain the low effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine against H3N2 viruses, and suggest that alternative approaches should be accelerated for producing influenza vaccines as well as isolating clinical isolates.

Seasonal influenza vaccine does not always confer protection in vaccinated individuals. Vaccine candidates are selected from clinical isolates based on their antigenic properties. It is common to use chicken eggs for culturing clinical isolates and for large-scale production of vaccines. However, influenza virus often mutates to adapt to being grown in chicken eggs, which can influence antigenicity and hence vaccine effectiveness. Here, we structurally characterize an egg-adaptive substitution, namely L194P, in H3N2 virus hemagglutinin. Our results reveal that the L194P substitution substantially increases the flexibility of an epitope region that is commonly targeted by antibodies. Based on the binding affinity of a broadly neutralizing antibody and a panel of human serum antibodies, we further show that the L194P substitution dramatically changes the HA antigenicity. The change of the receptor-binding mode associated with the L194P substitution provides an explanation for its ability to successfully grow in eggs. Our study describes a mechanism for the low influenza vaccine effectiveness and reaffirms the urgency for replacing the egg-based production of influenza vaccines.

Here, we performed a structural study on HA L194P, a commonly found egg-adaptive substitution in the H3N2 subtype. Previous studies have demonstrated that L194P changes the antigenicity [ 20 ], and also decreases the immunogenicity of H3N2 HA [ 19 ]. Here, B-value analysis of crystal structures with the L194P substitution revealed increased conformational dynamics of the 190-helix, and to a lesser extent the 150-loop, that explains the antigenic effect of L194P substitution on antigenic site B and its decreased affinity against an RBS-targeted broadly neutralizing antibody and human serum antibodies. Structural characterization further showed that the L194P substitution alters the receptor-binding mode and specificity. These structural and biophysical characterizations of the egg-adaptive substitution L194P therefore have important implications for the effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine against H3N2 viruses.

Despite the first commercial influenza vaccines being approved in the US more than 70 years ago [ 6 ], complete and broad protection from an influenza vaccine has remained out of reach [ 7 , 8 ]. Furthermore, in the past decade, the effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine against H3N2 viruses has been particularly low [ 8 ]. While the vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be 67% for seasonal H1N1 (pre-2009), 73% for H1N1pdm09, and 54% for type B, it was only 33% for H3N2 viruses [ 8 ]. Studies have attributed this low effectiveness of the H3N2 vaccine to the egg-based production process [ 9 , 10 ]. Although eggs provide a cost effective way to grow influenza virus, the abundance of avian-type receptors on the chorioallantoic membrane [ 11 , 12 ] often results in selection of variants that increase binding to avian-type receptors (NeuAcα2-3Gal), and reduce binding to human-type receptors (NeuAcα2-6Gal) [ 11 , 13 – 16 ]. More importantly, these egg-adaptive substitutions on the HA have also been shown to impact antigenicity [ 17 – 22 ], leading to a decrease in vaccine effectiveness [ 9 , 22 ]. The underlying mechanism is further elucidated by a recent structural study on RBS-targeted antibodies induced by an egg-adapted H1N1 vaccine strain [ 22 ]. Nonetheless, the structural and biophysical mechanisms involved in the antigenicity changes and the practical consequences to vaccine effectiveness resulting from egg-adaptive substitutions in H3N2 viruses remain to be fully explored.

Recognition and neutralization of influenza virus by the immune system has been a subject of extensive research due to its profound implications for vaccine design. The majority of human antibodies against influenza virus that are elicited by natural infection or vaccination target the globular head domain of the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. In H3N2 viruses, five major antigenic sites A-E are the primary targets [ 1 – 3 ]. However, most of the globular head domain has an intrinsically high mutational tolerance [ 4 , 5 ] that facilitates escape from the immune system. The receptor-binding site (RBS) is conserved but can still accommodate some level of mutation to evade antibody recognition. Rapid antigenic drift of influenza viruses can occur without perturbing vital functions and necessitates almost annual reformulation of the influenza vaccine.

Results

Prevalence of HA L194P substitution in egg-passaged human H3N2 isolates The HA L194P substitution rapidly emerges in human H3N2 viruses during passaging in chicken eggs [19, 23–25]. To examine the frequency of the L194P substitution in natural versus egg-passaged human viruses, the HA amino-acid sequences of human H3N2 isolates were retrieved from Global Initiative for Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID; http://gisaid.org). We compared the HA sequences from human H3N2 isolates that were passaged in eggs versus isolates that were sequenced without any passaging (Fig 1A). Around 36% of egg-passaged human isolates possessed a Pro at residue 194, whereas all unpassaged human isolates contained Leu at residue 194. The frequency of the L194P substitution increased from ~2% after one passage in eggs to ~20% after two passages (Fig 1B), whereas after three or more passages, it stabilized around at ~37%. Interestingly, L194P is not observed in egg-passaged pandemic H1N1 (“swine flu”) human isolates (Fig 1C), suggesting that L194P is an H3N2-specific substitution. Subsequently, we focused on A/Brisbane/10/2007 (Bris07), a WHO-recommended H3N2 vaccine strain from 2008 to 2010 and a commonly employed model strain for experimental studies. There are 11 amino-acid sequences of Bris07 HA deposited in the NCBI protein database (S1 Table), one of which has an ambiguous amino acid at residue 194. For the other 10 sequences, five have Pro and the other five have Leu at residue 194. In fact, similar observations were made for the currently recommended H3N2 vaccine strains A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (HK14) and A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (Sing16). HK14 is a recommended H3N2 vaccine strain for the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 northern hemisphere influenza seasons, and also for the 2016 and 2017 southern hemisphere influenza seasons, whereas Sing14 is a recommended H3N2 vaccine strain for the 2018 southern hemisphere influenza season. In the eight amino-acid sequences of HK14 HA deposited in GISAID (S2 Table), four have Pro and four have Leu at residue 194. Similarly, in the four amino-acid sequences of Sing16 HA deposited in GISAID (S2 Table), three have Pro and one has Leu at residue 194. Together, these observations clearly underscore the importance of structural and functional characterization of the L194P substitution in the context of its ramifications for vaccine development.
