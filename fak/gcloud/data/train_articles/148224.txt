Who has Trump endorsed in midterm elections? A list
Ahead of the midterm elections, President Trump has taken to Twitter to inform his millions of followers who he is endorsing – and he’s confident his support will make the difference.

“As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason), they will win,” Trump said in August. “I LOVE the people, [and] they certainly seem to like the job I’m doing. If I find the time, in between China, Iran, the economy and much more, which I must, we will have a giant Red Wave!”

In the weeks leading up to the midterm elections – in which Democrats are hoping to regain control of the House and Senate – Trump has also traveled across the country for Republican candidates.
