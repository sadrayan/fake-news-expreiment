Reckless and wasteful spending are moving this country towards an unprecedented tax hike; one that can be avoided if the federal government finally respects the bottom line, just as families do when balancing their own checkbooks. The practice of excessive borrowing and deficit spending in Washington must stop. To do otherwise robs the American people of their right to responsible government, and places on future generations of Americans the burden of paying the bill for today's waste and indiscipline. "We are fooling no one. The bills come due and we rack up big debts. With those debts come higher and higher interest payments each year. Instead of spending the taxpayers' dollars on real priorities, more and more of them will be devoted simply to keeping the bill collectors at bay." -Senator John McCain Sign this petition if you believe, as John McCain does, that Washington can and must get its house in order.
