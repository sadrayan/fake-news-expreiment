"Roughly 38,000 American service members remain in Afghanistan, the U.S. military told CBS News Thursday, as troop levels hang in the balance with a U.S.-Afghan security agreement still unsigned. "

"The Pentagon has proposed leaving 10,000 troops in Afghanistan after 2014 but then draw down the number of troops to zero by the end of 2016, CBS News confirmed Wednesday."

Here’s another source as well. It’s from the Brookings Institute in Dec. 2013

You’ll see on the graph of US troops in Afghanistan that it has the number at 43,000 as of Dec. 2013.

Subject: Summing up

Per the candidate’s statement in the email blast, it looks to me like there were 34,000 troops in Afghanistan at the time the email went out (not more than 40,000) and that a general had recommended that the US reduce troops to 10,000--or zero, which I would be Alameel’s preference, correct?

I am basing the second part of this on news articles published Jan. 21 and 22:

News story, "U.S. Military Eyes Afghan Force of 10,000, or a Pullout," New York Times, Jan. 21, 2014 (accessed Feb. 13, 2014)

News story, "Reports: US military wants 10,000 troops or none in post-2014 Afghanistan," Stars and Stripes, Jan. 22, 2014 (Nexis search)

News story, "U.S. Military Proposal Seeks Shorter Afghan Stay," Wall Street Journal, posted online Jan. 21, 2014 (accessed Feb. 14, 2014)

Anything else we should consider in rating the accuracy of the claim?

We were basing the number on the Brookings Institute report from three weeks prior to February 7, which indicated there were more than 40,000 troops still in Afghanistan.

However, regardless of whether the number of troops serving in Afghanistan is 34,000, 40,000 or even just one, it's still too many. We need to withdraw all our troops from Afghanistan immediately and spend the billions back home to create jobs, ensure a quality education for all children, and protect Social Security and Medicare.

Let me know if you need anything else.
