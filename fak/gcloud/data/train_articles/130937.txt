Nancy Pelosi just announced a new scheme to take down Donald Trump in 2020
The Democrat Party is still reeling over their 2016 loss.

They can’t believe crooked Hillary took a beating at the ballot box.

So now they’ve unveiled a new scheme to take down Donald Trump in 2020.

Nancy Pelosi just came out in favor of lowering the voting age to 16.

In a press conference, Pelosi spoke of “capturing” kids in high school “when they’re interested in all of this.”

Her comments are in connection to the so-called “For The People Act,” which would overhaul U.S. election and campaign finance laws, if passed.

The Daily Caller Reports:

 “That’s a subject of debate but my view is that I would welcome it, but I’ve been in that position for a long time.” The issue of lowering the voting age came up for debate in the House as an amendment last week on the “For The People Act,” a Democratic pushed bill (H.R. 1) that would overhaul U.S. election and campaign finance laws. Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley introduced the amendment, but it failed 126-305. Since 2013, thirteen states have proposed bills to lower the voting age. Some of the proposals are strictly for school board elections while others are for state elections. H.R. 1, however, did pass the House through its Democratic majority, despite opposition from the ACLU.

Democrats are frightened.

They worry they will lose to Trump again in 2020.

So they are concocting every possible scheme to get him out of office.

Now they are trying to take over the voting system and make a mockery of the U.S. electoral process.

They know 16-year-olds are more naive than the general public and are susceptible to indoctrination by union-label public school teachers, so they are trying to flood the voter base with them.

If they succeed, it could be bad news for our fragile republic.
