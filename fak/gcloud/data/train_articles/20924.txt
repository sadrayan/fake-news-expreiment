No Florida Price Controls!
— A Note From Americans For Tax Reform —

From our recent blog on ATR.org:

In a new editorial, Importing Bad Ideas on Drug Prices, The Wall Street Journal criticizes legislation in Florida that would require the state to set up a program to import drugs from Canada.

The importation of drugs from countries with socialized medicine is a policy that has long been supported by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and opposed by proponents of free markets and limited government. Yet in Florida, importation has been advancing with Republican support. The WSJ editorial concludes:

“Democrats once pushed importation as disguised price controls, but Republicans who understand markets helped to stop it. With Republicans now aping Democrats, this is a dangerous moment for the world’s most productive and dynamic market for medicine.”

Indeed, the importation of drugs from Canada is a highly misguided idea. While importation may sound like a reasonable free market solution, it is actually a clever ploy to trick proponents of limited government into supporting socialist policies that would jeopardize the development of the next generation of life-saving, life-improving medicines.
