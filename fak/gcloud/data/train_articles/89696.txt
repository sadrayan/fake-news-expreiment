Support for Planned Parenthood Holds Steady

Voter attitudes about Planned Parenthood have not changed in the nearly three months since the release of the first secretly-taken video showing representatives of the group discussing the sales value of body parts of aborted babies. But for a sizable majority, it’s an issue they’ll remember come election time.

A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 53% of Likely U.S. Voters have a favorable opinion of Planned Parenthood, including 29% with a Very Favorable one. Forty-two percent (42%) view the reproductive health organization unfavorably, with 30% who hold a Very Unfavorable view of it. (To see survey question wording, click here.)

The survey of 1,000 Likely Voters was conducted on September 30 and October 1, 2015 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC. See methodology.
