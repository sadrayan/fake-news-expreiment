As part of a recent data quality audit, the Metropolitan Police Department determined that our summary crime statistics were not capturing a small proportion of property crimes since the deployment of our new Records Management System in August 2015. These specific crimes were reported through the Office of Unified Communications’ (OUC) Telephone Reporting Unit (TRU) and crime categories impacted were: Theft; Motor Vehicle Theft; and Theft from Auto. Please note that this technical issue did not affect the handling of these cases as they were regularly transferred to MPD detectives for investigation and follow-up. The Department has corrected this technical issue, and the summary crime statistics presented here as well as on the public crime mapping website reflect this update.
