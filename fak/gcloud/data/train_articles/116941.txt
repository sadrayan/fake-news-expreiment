Trump Filed For Reelection In 2020 On Jan 20 2017. Why It Matters.
These fascists are evil to the core. Here’s a Tweetstorm from @resisterhood giving her reasons as to why she thinks this is important.

x First and foremost, it is NOT NORMAL. Obama filed for 2012 reelection in April 2011. Incumbent declaring before midterms is unheard of. /2 Ã¢ÂÂ The Resisterhood (@resisterhood) January 28, 2017

x Because he's acting as Trump the candidate, not Trump the president. Different rules apply. /4 Ã¢ÂÂ The Resisterhood (@resisterhood) January 28, 2017

x It means they can't speak negatively about him. Imagine @PPact having to convey risk to #PlannedParenthood w/ limits on how to address. /6 Ã¢ÂÂ The Resisterhood (@resisterhood) January 28, 2017

x And further muddies the already swampy ethical waters of financial gain, #conflictsofinterest & business transactions. /8 Ã¢ÂÂ The Resisterhood (@resisterhood) January 28, 2017

x Diabolical maneuvering to skirt all conventional forms of #resistance. Norms don't matter; it's all about finding new ways to silence us /10 Ã¢ÂÂ The Resisterhood (@resisterhood) January 28, 2017

x This is IRS regulation re. 501c3s. They're smart, creative & used to this, but adds add'l hurdles/potential legal battles they don't need. pic.twitter.com/M9KITfVYWo Ã¢ÂÂ The Resisterhood (@resisterhood) January 29, 2017

x W/ unprecedented legal/Constitutional challenges & Bannon at helm, don't rule out attacks on previously held norms re. how non-profs operate Ã¢ÂÂ The Resisterhood (@resisterhood) January 29, 2017

We are in a fight to save the future.

Resist!
