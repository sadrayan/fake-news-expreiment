The protesters oppose a bill, adopted in the first reading by the Russian State Duma. The legislation proposed raising the retirement age from 60 to 65 years for men and from 55 to 63 years for women. Those changes are to be implemented gradually starting from 2019. President Putin, however, proposed amendments that set the retirement age for men and women at 65 and 60 years, respectively.
