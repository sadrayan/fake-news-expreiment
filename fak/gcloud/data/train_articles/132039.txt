Donor challenge: A generous supporter will match your donation 3 to 1 right now. $5 becomes $20! Dear Internet Archive Supporter, I ask only once a year: please help the Internet Archive today. We’re an independent, non-profit website that the entire world depends on. Our work is powered by donations averaging about $41. If everyone chips in $5, we can keep this going for free. For the cost of a used paperback, we can share a book online forever. When I started this, people called me crazy. Collect web pages? Why? Who’d want to read a book on a screen? For 21 years, we’ve backed up the Web, so if government data or entire newspapers disappear, we can say: We Got This. The key is to keep improving—and to keep it free. We have only 150 staff but run one of the world’s top websites. We’re dedicated to reader privacy. We never accept ads. But we still need to pay for servers and staff. The Internet Archive is a bargain, but we need your help. If you find our site useful, please chip in. Thank you. —Brewster Kahle, Founder, Internet Archive I ask only once a year: please help the Internet Archive today. We’re an independent, non-profit website that the entire world depends on.
