As mentioned earlier, the White House would be the appropriate POC for the president’s statement about people watching the hurricane from their boats.

As to the Coast Guard’s role during the 2017 hurricanes, the service - working alongside our federal, state and local partner agencies - saved nearly 12,000 Americans.

Our former commandant, Admiral Paul Zukunft, discussed the Coast Guard’s response in his 2018 State of the Coast Guard Address, which you can find here: https://www.uscg.mil/SOTCG2018/
