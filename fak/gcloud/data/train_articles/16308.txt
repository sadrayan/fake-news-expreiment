I’m writing at the direction of Stacey Nicchio because we’re fact-checking the claim in Sara Stevenson’s letter here suggesting committee witnesses are called randomly no matter when they sign up to testify. I am interested in how this might apply to House committees.

Does this concern apply? Why or why not? Are there House rules or state laws that pertain? Other recommended sources?

Thanks.

The committee in question was a Senate committee, not a House committee. The chairs of House committees have the discretion to decide the order of witnesses. Many House chairmen choose to call upon witnesses in the order in which they sign up.
