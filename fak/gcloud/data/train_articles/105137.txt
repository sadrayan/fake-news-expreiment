Politically incorrect America
Like who gives a shit how he spellt too or to....the point is they took these cartoons off the air for being too violent....I watch my daughter and her friends play video games that are so realistic you think it is a movie....and they do not bat an eye

about blowing the crap out of each other but they have been taught morals, respect, non violence to others ,anti bullying...by us as their parents.

The same as I was taught by my parents...enough is enough...we got to stop blaming poor behaviour from the kids today on TV, games and whatever a doctor has diagnosed them with.

Be a parent to your kids and take responsibility for their actions....you are the one that is supposed to teach them what's right including which "to" to use..
