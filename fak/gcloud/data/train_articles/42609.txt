Fifty-Six Ms-13 Members Indicted
BOSTON – Fifty-six alleged leaders, members, and associates of the criminal organization “La Mara Salvatrucha,” or “MS-13,” have been indicted on federal racketeering conspiracy charges, including charges related to murder, conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder, and drug trafficking. Various defendants are also charged with drug trafficking, firearm violations, immigration offenses, and fraudulent document charges.

This morning, over 400 federal, state and local law enforcement officers carried out the arrests of the numerous MS-13 leaders, members, and associates in the Boston area, including in the cities of Chelsea, East Boston, Everett, Lynn, Revere and Somerville. Fifteen of the indicted defendants were already in custody on federal, state or immigration charges.

According to court documents, in 2012, MS-13 became the first, and remains the only, street gang to be designated by the United States government as a “transnational criminal organization.” Today, MS-13 is one of the largest criminal organizations in the United States, and is an international criminal organization with over 6,000 members in the United States, with a presence in at least forty-six states and the District of Columbia, as well as over 30,000 members internationally, mostly in El Salvador, Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala. In Massachusetts, MS-13 is largely composed of immigrants and descendants of immigrants from El Salvador and has members operating throughout the Commonwealth, with higher concentrations in Chelsea, East Boston, Everett, Lynn, Revere, and Somerville.

Violence is a central tenet of MS-13, as evidenced by its core motto -- “mata, viola, controla,” translated as, “kill, rape, control.” During the course of this investigation, this violence was directed against rival gangs, particularly the 18th Street gang, and anyone who was perceived to have disrespected MS-13. The 18th Street gang, another criminal organization in Central America with members living in the United States, has been a longstanding rival of MS-13. MS-13 members and associates often commit murders and attempted murders using machetes, knives, and chains in order to intimidate rival gang members.

During the course of this investigation, it is alleged that MS-13 actively recruited prospective members, known as “paros,” inside local high schools from communities with significant immigrant populations from Central America, including Chelsea High School, East Boston High School and Everett High School. Prospective members were typically 14 or 15 years old. Under the strict rules of MS-13, as communicated to the local “cliques” by the leaders of MS-13 in El Salvador, these prospective members must engage in significant violent criminal activity on behalf of the criminal organization, usually the killing of a rival gang member, in order to become a full-fledged member of MS-13, known as a “homeboy.” The indictment alleges that several of the defendants are responsible for the murders of at least five people since 2014, in Chelsea and East Boston, as well as the attempted murder of at least 14 people.

The indictment further alleges that members of the MS-13 organization in Massachusetts sell cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, and commit robberies, in order to generate income to pay monthly dues to the incarcerated leadership of MS-13 in El Salvador. This money is allegedly used to pay for weapons, cell phones, shoes, food, and other supplies for MS-13 members in and out of jail in El Salvador.

The RICO conspiracy charge provides a maximum sentence of 20 years, or life if the violation is based on racketeering activity for which the maximum penalty includes life imprisonment; three years of supervised release; and a fine of $250,000. Depending on the drug quantity, the drug trafficking conspiracy and distribution charges provide a maximum sentence of 20 years, 40 years, or life; a minimum of three, four or five years of supervised release; and fines of $1 million, $5 million and $10 million. The charge of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime provides a maximum sentence of five or seven years on and after any other sentence depending on how the firearm was used. The charge of being an alien in possession of a firearm and ammunition provides a maximum sentence of 10 years, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000. The charge of illegal re-entry of a deported alien provides a maximum sentence of 10 years, three years of supervised release, and a $250,000 fine. The transfer of false identification document charge provides a maximum sentence of 15 years, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000. The purchase of a fraudulent social security card charge provides a maximum sentence of five years, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000.

Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division; Matthew Etre, Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Boston; Colonel Richard D. McKeon, Superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police made the announcement today.
