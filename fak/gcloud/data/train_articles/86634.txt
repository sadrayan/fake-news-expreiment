Obama-bashing G.I. retracts claim senator 'blew off' Afghanistan troops
BY James Gordon Meek

Today's Daily News reports on an [**Obama-trashing e-mail ricocheting around the Internet**](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/07/24/2008-07-24_army_offi...), which is signed by a soldier who allegedly saw the Democratic candidate in Afghanistan. It sparked a fierce partisan debate across the blogosphere yesterday over its authenticity. The e-mail certainly appeared at first to be a budding Snopes classic. [**Websites**](http://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/07/from-gi-in-afgh.html) posting the soldier's screed attributed it to an officer from the Army, Marines or Air Force - a sure sign of a fake, right?

The News reported it wasn't actually a hoax letter - though the military officially disputes the e-mail's factual accuracy. The original poster attributed the message to an anonymous Air Force officer in the hope it would give the author, a Utah Army National Guard intelligence officer, some cover. But the Army captain's wife had already forwarded it to others who posted the e-mail in full with the couple's names.

In his e-mail (read the full text after the jump), the Task Force Wasatch "battle captain" beefed about the Illinois senator supposedly breezing into Bagram Airfield this week and blowing off G.I.s on his way to a staged photo-op to play basketball.

"I swear we got more thanks from the NBA Basketball Players or the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders than from one of the Senators, who wants to be the President of the United States. I just don't understand how anyone would want him to be our Commander-and-Chief. It was almost that he was scared to be around those that provide the freedom for him and our great country," the captain wrote.

Now the Bagram captain is dialing back, having signed the viral e-mail with his name, rank and unit - a possible violation of military regulations barring political statements. This morning, he sent The Mouth a new statement (punctuation corrected):

"I am writing this to ask that you delete my email and not forward it. After checking my sources, information that was put out in my email was wrong. This email was meant only for my family. Please respect my wishes and delete the email and if there are any blogs you have my email portrayed on I would ask if you would take it down too. Thanks for your understanding."

An Army officer familiar with the incident told The Mouth today that the writer is "devastated that the letter was made public. It was never his intention that it go beyond members of his family."

I don't know each of your personal political convictions, and apologize if anyone finds this offensive. I thought it was important enough to share. This is Jeff's first hand view of Senator Obama.

Hello everyone,

As you know I am not a very political person. I just wanted to pass along that Senator Obama came to Bagram Afghanistan for about an hour on his visit to 'The War Zone'. I wanted to share with you what happened. He got off the plane and got into a bullet proof vehicle, got to the area to meet with the Major General (2 Star) who is the commander here at Bagram.

As the Soldiers where lined up to shake his hand he blew them off and didn't say a word as he went into the conference room to meet the General. As he finished,

the vehicles took him to the ClamShell (pretty much a big top tent that military personnel can play basketball or work out in with weights) so he could take his publicity pictures playing basketball. He again shunned the opportunity to talk to Soldiers to thank them for their service.

So really he was just here to make a showing for the American's back home that he is their candidate for President. I think that if you are going to make an effort to come all the way over here you would thank those that are providing the freedom that they are providing for you.

I swear we got more thanks from the NBA Basketball Players or the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders than from one of the Senators, who wants to be the President of the United States. I just don't understand how anyone would want him to be our Commander-and-Chief. It was almost that he was scared to be around those that provide the freedom for him and our great country.

If this is blunt and to the point I am sorry but I want you all to know what kind of caliber of person he really is. What you see in the news is all fake.

In service,

[REDACTED BY THE DAILY NEWS]
