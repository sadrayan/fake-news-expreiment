What's in the Cassidy-Graham health care bill
The Republican co-authors of the latest effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act released a revised bill on Sept. 25, aimed at winning over senators who had expressed concerns or outright opposition to the bill. The changes would increase funding for Alaska, Arizona and Maine, home of holdouts Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), John McCain (R-Arizona) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), according a summary obtained by The Post.

The bill, crafted by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), essentially turns control of the health-care markets over to the states. Rather than funding Medicaid and subsidies directly, that money would be put into a block grant that a state could use to develop any health-care system it wants. It also allows states to opt out of many ACA regulations. “If you like Obamacare, you can keep it,” Graham has said, using a common nickname for the health-care law. “If you want to replace it, you can.”

In reality, that may not be true. The Medicaid expansion and subsidy funding would be cut sharply compared to current spending, going to zero in a decade.
