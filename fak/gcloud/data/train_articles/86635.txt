Mouth Of The Potomac
Barack Obama mocked Hillary Clinton for talking like Annie Oakley back in the primaries, but just now challenged John McCain to a rootin’, shootin’ duel on tax policy, just like Wild Bill Hickok.

Obama was speaking in Springfield, Mo., where he mentioned that Hickok had his first duel on the town square. He then let on that Obama family legend — unverified, he admitted — has it that he is distantly related to Wild Bill.

“I’m ready to duel John McCain on taxes, right here, right now,” Obama boasted. “I’m a quick draw.”

He then launched into his spiel about how he and McCain both want to cut taxes, only he says McCain wants to help rich people, while he wants to help the middle class.

We’re not sure how Team McCain will respond to the gun slinging imagery, but we’re pretty sure they’ll take Obama up on the offer of dueling over tax policy.

We’re not sure Obama meant it though, since he’s turned down McCain’s request for a series of Lincoln-Douglas style town hall debates.

Update: McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds responds: “If Barack Obama was so interested in this so-called ‘duel’ than why did Obama buckle at the knees when he was invited to meet John McCain at 10 town hall meetings. The truth is Barack Obama doesn’t have the experience to walk the walk.”
