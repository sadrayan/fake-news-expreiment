Foreign Countries with Universal Health Care

The following listing is provided as a courtesy to use as a reference when determining the applicable surcharge on services provided to foreign patients.

If the patient resides in any of the countries listed, then that patient may be a part of the country's national healthcare system, rather than be insured through a private insurer. If they are part of the country's national healthcare system, that country is deemed to be an unspecified payor and subject only to the current elector surcharge rate which is payable to the provider of services.

While the Department regularly reviews this list and updates it as needed, it cannot attest to its complete accuracy and assumes no responsibility for any inaccuracy that may exist. Providers are encouraged to contact the patient's third party payor for questions regarding a possible association with that country's national health care system. Verifiable documentation in determining the appropriate surcharge rate should be maintained for audit purposes.
