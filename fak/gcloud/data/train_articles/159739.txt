Third Party Offers and Software 3.1. We make no claims or promises with respect to any third party, such as the businesses or advertisers listed within our Service. 3.2. Accordingly, we are not liable to you for any loss or damage that might arise from their actions or omissions, including, for example, if another user or business misuses your content, identity or personal information, or if you have a negative experience with one of the businesses or advertisers or their products listed or featured on the site. 3.3. Your purchase and use of products or services offered by third parties through the site is at your own discretion and risk and subject to the terms and conditions of the third party.

4.

Obligations concerning your data and contact information 4.1. You are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide us on you are correct, complete, legally permitted and free from any rights of third parties, and for informing us of any changes to the information you have provided. 4.2. You are responsible for informing us of any changes to the information you have provided. The address and contact details of the customers are kept up to date.

If a registration is incomplete, we are entitled to delete the user account within one week.

5.

Obligations of the users 5.1. Users warrant that their content, in particular reviews, self-presentations and inquiries, is consistent with the truth, permitted by law and unencumbered by third-party rights. 5.2. The following content in particular is not permitted: Pestering (stalking), threats, insults, and the assertion of incorrect facts; content that may be detrimental to the development or education of children or young adults or put them at risk; content that infringes third-party copyrights, trademark rights, competition rights or rights to privacy; content that is racist or xenophobic, glorifies violence or is seditious, pornographic, degrading or immoral; content that may affect the health of individuals; chain letters, bulk messages with or without advertiser content (spamming); links to sites with such content; sweepstakes, contests, lottery draws or similar promotions; publication of private data (such as e-mail addresses); commercial advertising or references praising other competitor services. 5.3. If users create content that is subject to certain labeling or information requirements (e.g. legal information on the content provider), users are required to appropriately fulfill the respective labeling and information duties. 5.4. The Service Provider has the right to remove non-relevant content, in particular content that does not relate to the specific thematic area of a Service (for example, political or religious topics in a range of games). 5.5. If users can directly contact and invite other users, this contact and invitation option may not be used for advertising purposes or to otherwise harass the contacted users (for example, through repeated requests for a reply even if no answer is forthcoming or a wish not to be contacted has been expressly stated). The Service Provider reserves the right to restrict the function both generally and in individual cases if users should feel harassed. 5.6. The Service Provider reserves the right not to release content or to reverse the release thereof if there is concrete evidence to suggest that the content is in breach of statutory regulations, official prohibitions, the rights of third parties or public morality. The Service Provider is not, however, obliged to verify the content in advance. 5.7. The Service Provider reserves the right to restrict the number or function of affiliate and similar advertising links placed by users and to prohibit the use of such links altogether.

6.

Responsibility for content and information 6.1. The Service Provider is neither responsible nor liable for user-generated content or for linked content on other websites. 6.2. The Service Provider wishes to point out that no claim is made regarding the accuracy, completeness, legal admissibility and absence of any rights of third parties of the content provided within the Service. Content is provided for fun and entertainment purposes only (such as Horoscopes, quizzes, tests, etc.), and as such, it comes with no guarantee of accuracy or usability of information and/or advice and/or results contained within. The content, the IQ and knowledge tests and all other tests, quizzes and horoscopes are non-scientific fun-content and can never replace medical diagnoses, scientific testing methods or professional advice. Such content is to be understood as non-binding information, recommendations and statements. In particular, no guarantee is offered that the content of the Service can be used in each country in which it is available. This restriction is due to the global nature of the Internet. 6.3. The user in question, and not the Service Provider, is responsible for user reviews, comments and ratings. 6.4. Users and other rights holders can complain to the Service Provider about content, stating the content and the criteria by which they have found fault with it, and apply for the correction or deletion of such content. The Service Provider may forward the complaint to the users responsible for the content in question and give them a reasonable period of time in which to comment. The publication of any content reported as inappropriate can be reversed until such time as it has been verified.

7.

Sanctions 7.1. As the integrity and functionality of the network is essential for the Service Provider, sanctions will be imposed against a user if the Service Provider has concrete evidence to suggest that the user is acting in breach of statutory regulations, third-party rights, public morality and/or these TOS. 7.2. When choosing the sanction to be imposed, the Service Provider will take into account the legitimate interests of the user concerned and consider, inter alia, whether the case involves non-culpable misconduct or a culpable infringement. The following graduated sanctions are available to the Service Provider: a) the partial and complete deletion of the content of a user, b) the issue of a caution to a user, c) the restriction of the use of applications, d) the temporary blocking of a user, e) the permanent revocation/termination of the rights of a user, possibly linked to an exclusion order.

With regard to the geographic, material, temporal and personal scope, the above provision of rights is effected only insofar as it is required for our fulfillment of the contractual services as well as the presentation and information on the functions and ways our services are used (e.g. as examples) and subsequently expires automatically.

Special Terms and Conditions for Publishing 11.1. The following Terms of Service (hereinafter referred to as the "Publishing ToS") shall govern the Publishing in addition to the general ToS. In the event of any conflict between the Publishing ToS and the ToS, the Publishing ToS shall prevail. 11.2. We grant the Publisher a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license for Publishing of any Publishing Items made available for Publishing within Publisher's Site. Publisher warrants and undertakes that it will use the Publishing Items solely within its own Publisher's Sites and solely for the purposes explicitly permitted hereunder. All rights which are not expressly granted herein are reserved by us, including for the avoidance of doubt, all data collected by us in connection with the Publishing. 11.3. All Publishing Items shall be clearly identified at all times using the provided labels, logos, trademarks and service marks which may not be removed from the provided Publishing Items. We shall be entitled to announce the Publication in any media, including, but not limited to, in its partner's list and for such purpose Publisher hereby grants us an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license to use Publisher's name, logo, label or any other trademarks or symbols identified with the Publisher. 11.4. Unless otherwise stated neither Publisher nor we shall be entitled to any compensation for and/or in connection with the Publishing. 11.5. The Publisher agrees that the Publishing Items are ad-supported and therefore we may add any advertising materials to, or otherwise use, any Publishing Items that are embedded in the Publisher's Site for any advertisement, promotion or marketing purposes, according to its sole discretion (hereinafter referred to as "Publishing Advertisements"). The Publisher shall not independently add any advertising materials, of any kind, to any Publishing Items, especially in a manner that obfuscates, hides, covers or blocks the Publishing Items or the Publishing Advertisements. 11.6. The Publisher shall maintain and display a privacy policy which shall comply with all applicable laws, our ToS, and our privacy policy to which the Publisher shall be entitled to refer users by a link to be incorporated in the privacy policy of the Publisher's Site (hereinafter referred to as "Publisher Privacy Policy"). In the event of any conflict between the Publisher Privacy Policy with our Publishing-ToS, the ToS and privacy policy the latter shall prevail. 11.7. The Publisher shall not change, alter, remove, block or otherwise prevent the display in the Publisher's Site of any Publishing Advertisements, our ToS, our privacy policy or any other first-party and third-party rules and policies provided with the Publishing Items. 11.8.

(b) Not to use the Embedding Service in any way which conflicts with Content restrictions of these ToS. (c) Not to use any method which may lead to falsely generated or artificially-inflated revenues in connection with the Publishing, including, without limitation, the automatic redirection of visitors, the induce of users to click on Advertisements based on incentives, blind text links, misleading links, forced clicks, or because advertising has been altered so or any other method that may lead to artificially high numbers of delivered clicks. 11.9. The Publisher agrees that we, or anyone delegated on our behalf shall have the right, but not duty, to monitor Publisher's compliance with these Publishing ToS, in any form or technology chosen by our sole discretion. 11.10. The Publisher may stop using the Publishing Items at any time. We also may block, remove and prevent the display and use of any Publishing Items at any time. Upon termination, all licenses, and any other rights and services we provide to the Publisher shall cease and terminate immediately.

12.

Remuneration and Billing 12.1. The provisions of this section apply if a contract is concluded between the user and the Service Provider for the provision of fee-based services. If the acquisition and payment processes are to be carried out via a third-party service provider (such as Apple iTunes or Google Play), the contractual terms of said provider will apply in this regard and take priority over the regulations in this section. 12.2. The remuneration currently owed is based on the chosen plan and is quoted net. Statutory VAT applicable at the time of invoicing is charged in addition. The remuneration is due to payment at the beginning of each payment interval. 12.3. We reserve the right to change the scale of remuneration at any time. With regard to current contracts, such change shall take effect only from the beginning of the following contracting period. 12.4. You may settle the remuneration using one of the payment methods we have offered to you. 12.5. The period for submission of pre-notifications by the provider to the customer within the SEPA Direct Debit scheme is two days. 12.6. You will be provided with the invoices electronically. 12.7. Should it not be possible to have an invoice paid by direct debit, you shall bear all consequential costs. These include especially bank charges in connection with the return of direct debits and comparable fees to the extent that you are responsible for the event that triggers the costs. We can send you payment reminders electronically. 12.8. Should you fall into arrears with your payments, we have the right to refuse to fulfill payments due to you and to block access to the user account until such default has been rectified. In such cases we will normally notify you of such at least 10 working days in advance to rectify such default. In the case of users who are consumers, the arrears must not be only marginally and the blocking must not be unreasonable for the user. Our other legal and contractual rights with regard to payment delay shall remain unaffected. 12.9. Should you fall into arrears with your payment, you must expect to be charged 5% interest for late payment above the base interest rate effective for the place of our registered office. Default interest will be charged, even without a written warning, if the payment is not made at the agreed date. We reserve the right to raise a claim for a higher value of compensation for such delay. 12.10. You may offset only uncontested or legally binding debts against our claims, insofar as these are not claims for completion or the rectification of faults. You are entitled to a right of retention only for counterclaims arising from the contract that forms the basis of these ToS.

13.

Termination 13.1. A termination of the contract is possible at any time on the free-of-charge plan. 13.2. In case of fee-based plans the contract term for the use of our Service is determined for chargeable plans by the selected payment interval. Unless otherwise stated, the contract will be prolonged automatically upon the expiry of the contract term by the same period, insofar as it has not been previously terminated giving notice of seven days before contract termination. 13.3. Users can object to any consent to receive e-mails and messages in the context of the Service. 12.4. If users desist from using a function or a platform version of the Service (such as the Facebook application but not the mobile application), this is not tantamount to the cancellation of the entire Service. Users can declare their cancellation of the entire Service by notifying the Service Provider and, where applicable to the Service in question, through the use of cancellation or account deletion options, and also by clicking on the termination or "unsubscribe" link of, or, as the case may be, in the e-mails of the Service. 13.5. Both contracting parties reserve the right to an early extraordinary termination of the contract for important reasons. An extraordinary termination is permitted in particular where you remain in default with your payment obligations for two months. Where necessary, a written warning concerning the objectionable conduct must precede the extraordinary termination. 13.6. In case of contract termination, you are responsible for saving your data before your contract expires. 13.7. For the avoidance of doubt, termination of our services Service shall not limit us from pursuing other remedies to which we are entitled under these Publisher Terms and Conditions, any other agreement or under any applicable law, including, without limitation, any injunctive relief. 13.8. Posts and comments, their content and other comparable content will remain within the Service out of consideration for other users if this is required, for example, to ensure that the meaning of conversations or advice or the like is not lost or inverted. Such content can be removed individually on request.

14.

Changes in Service 14.1. The scope of the Service we are offering, the user accounts and their technical design are derived from the current technical status of our Service and the description of services at the time of contract conclusion. 14.2. We reserve the right to extend, change or limit functions on the following grounds: a) if the changes are merely beneficial for users; b) if the changes serve to adjust the services with the applicable law, in particular if the legal situation changes; b) if the changes serve to comply with compelling legal or regulatory judgments; c) the respective change is necessary so far as to close existing security gaps; e) if the changes are of a purely technical or procedural nature with no significant impact for the user. Changes with only an insignificant impact on existing features do not represent "Changes in Service" as understood within limits of these ToS. This applies especially to changes of purely optical kind and mere changes in the arrangement of functions. 14.3. Where such change in the scope of functions impairs your contractual use of our Service to a more than negligible degree, you have the right to a fee adjustment or the termination of your contract.

15.

Availability 15.1. You hereby acknowledge that a 100% availability of our Service cannot be technically assured. However, we shall strive to keep our Service available as consistently as possible and assure you of an annual average availability of 98% in accordance with the following limitations in this section. 15.2. We cannot ensure the availability of our Service during times in which it cannot be accessed due to technical or other problems that lie outside our sphere of influence (Force Majeure, third-party culpability, necessary maintenance etc.). Where the safety of the network or the maintenance of network integrity is endangered for reasons beyond our sphere of responsibility, we can temporarily limit access to our Service as required. 15.3. You will be notified of foreseeable downtimes due to maintenance work in good time in advance. Claims in this respect can therefore not be deduced.

16.

Indemnity 16.1. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, any related companies, suppliers, licensors and partners, and the officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (hereinafter referred to as "Provider's Entities") of each of harmless, including costs, liabilities and legal fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party arising out of or relating to (i) user's access to or use of our Service, (ii) your violation of the ToS, (iii) any products or services purchased or obtained by users in connection with us, or (iv) the infringement by users, or any third party using user's account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. 16.2. We reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.
