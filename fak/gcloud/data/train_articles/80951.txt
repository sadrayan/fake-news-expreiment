Ald. Bob Donovan said Monday he intends to petition the Common Council early next year for a binding referendum asking Milwaukee residents if they support or oppose Mayor Tom Barrett's proposed $123.9 million streetcar line.

Donovan said he will need to collect more than 20,500 valid petition signatures to force a binding referendum on borrowing funds to pay for construction of the proposed streetcar line.

He will start circulating petitions after the Common Council acts on streetcar financing proposals in January, Donovan said. He is a candidate for mayor in the 2016 election and an opponent of streetcar service in Milwaukee.

"What is wrong with giving the people the chance to say 'yes' or 'no' to the streetcar project?" Donovan asked in a statement. He has scheduled a 1:30 p.m. Monday news conference at City Hall to announce the petition drive.

Barrett said last week he will ask the Common Council to create two downtown tax incremental financing districts to provide an estimated $49.3 million in additional public funding for the project. Money to repay borrowing would come from property taxes generated by new development in the two corridors.

Milwaukee already has allocated $64.6 million — $54.9 million in federal aid and $9.7 million from an existing tax incremental financing district — to pay for the initial phase of construction and streetcar purchases. Barrett also is seeking an additional $10 million in federal funds to pay for the project.

A proposed 2.1-mile downtown streetcar route would be built first. A 0.4-mile route extension to the lakefront is planned.
