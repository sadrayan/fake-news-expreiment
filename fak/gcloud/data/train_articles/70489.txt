After thirty-one years in the Navy following his graduation second in his class from the U.S. Naval Academy, this former (a) three-star admiral in the U.S. Navy and the recipient of a Ph.D. in Political Economy and Government from Harvard University, (b) manager of the seventy billion dollar budget for the Navy, (c) commander of and first head of the Navy's anti-terrorism organization (to mention just a few of his accomplishments) could have made a fortune working for a Fortune 500 company. Instead, as the grandson of an immigrant steelworker, his love of America led him to run successfully for the U.S. House of Representatives. As one who grew up in Virginia, is a resident of Ohio, and never lived in Pennsylvania, I wish that we could find other men with these qualifications to represent my state in the U.S. Senate.



For this reviewer, the striking characteristics of this candidate are his love for America, commitment to equal opportunities for all, concern for the enormous discrepancies in incomes and assets of our citizens today, belief that the government can use government partnerships with private enterprises, and extraordinary fund of knowledge. Unlike many of our senators, Sestak does not make nonspecific broad claims about his goals. He does not manufacture undocumented "facts" to support his rationale for his goals. He seems much more focused on what policies will promote the long-term health and growth of the U.S. than about the broad popularity of his goals. When he states a goal, he presents the facts that led him to formulate the goal; and he provides the reader with references to the sources from which he derived those facts. For me, this approach represents a refreshing contrast to the approaches of most of our legislators.
