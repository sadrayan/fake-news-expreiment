'Divine intervention' lands a baseball buyer for Ken Lanci's posh pad: Michael K. McIntyre's Tipoff
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Businessman Ken Lanci, well known from his self- funded independent run for Cuyahoga County executive, sold his Gates Mills home recently without even trying.

And the buyer? Former American League MVP and Boston Red Sox slugger Mo Vaughn.

Vaughn, whose wife Gail Turkovich-Vaughn is a Painesville native, is the president of Solon-based trucking company MVT Inc. (Mo Vaughn Transport). They have a 6-year-old daughter, Grace. Vaughn was looking for a home in Northeast Ohio and his real estate agent suggested they pay a visit to Lanci in Gates Mills.

Lanci said he'd had his 11,000-square-foot home on the market in the past, but got no takers.

"When it was on the market, we were thinking of buying bigger. But when it's for sale like that, the kitchen's got to be cleaned all the time, the bathrooms have to be cleaned, you have to make the beds. So I told my agent I wasn't going to list it again, but if he ever had someone it might work for, let us know," said Lanci.

"He told me it was a former ballplayer and I said, 'Oh yeah? Who?' And he says, 'Mo Vaughn,' " said Lanci. "And I said, 'Who's that?' "

Vaughn, who also runs a successful low-income housing redevelopment business in New York featured in the New York Times last year, visited Lanci's home on a recent Saturday and Lanci was all ears. "At 61, everything's for sale," he said.

Vaughn wrote an offer by Wednesday and the deal was done by Friday. It's set to close this week. Sale price: North of $2 million.

Lanci has now joined the ranks of the renters, living with his wife in Brecksville.

"Our oldest daughter lives here and she just adopted two children in October, so she now has four and my wife helps out a lot," he said. "So this truly was divine intervention."

And a heavenly bonus: Lanci got to take his famous tanning bed with him.
