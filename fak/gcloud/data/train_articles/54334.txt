U.S. Senate: Party Division
Note: Statistics listed below reflect party division immediately following the election, unless otherwise noted. The actual number of senators representing a particular party often changes during a Congress, due to the death or resignation of a senator, or as a consequence of a member changing parties.

1st Congress (1789-1791)

Other Parties: 0

Total Seats: 26

Note: Organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the 1790s, but political factions--from which organized parties evolved--began to appear almost immediately after establishment of the federal government. Those who supported the Washington administration were referred to as "pro-administration" and would eventually form the Federalist party, while those in opposition joined the emerging (Jeffersonian) Republican party.

Note: As the 106th Congress began, the division was 55 Republican seats and 45 Democratic seats, but this changed to 54-45 on July 13, 1999 when Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire switched from the Republican party to Independent status. On November 1, 1999, Smith announced his return to the Republican party, making the division once more 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats. Following the death of Senator Paul Coverdell (R-GA) on July 18, 2000, the balance shifted again, to 54 Republicans and 46 Democrats, when the governor appointed Zell Miller, a Democrat, to fill the vacancy.

On May 24, 2001, Senator James Jeffords of Vermont announced his switch from Republican to Independent status, effective June 6, 2001. Jeffords announced that he would caucus with the Democrats, giving the Democrats a one-seat advantage, changing control of the Senate from the Republicans back to the Democrats. Senator Thomas A. Daschle again became majority leader on June 6, 2001. Senator Paul D. Wellstone (D-MN) died on October 25, 2002, and Independent Dean Barkley was appointed to fill the vacancy.
