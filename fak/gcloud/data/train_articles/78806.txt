Republicans Request Obama Take Back Nomination of Dawn Johnson - Blog
At least 45 House Republicans have co-signed a letter to President Barack Obama in opposition to his nomination of Dawn Johnson for the head of the Office of Legal Counsel.

After Obama rescinded the Mexico City policy earlier year, to allow U.S. federal dollars to go towards foreign facilities that perform abortion services, pro-life politicians and supporters were angry. Obama assured those concerned that "we are united in our determination to prevent inintended pregnancies...[and] reduce the need for abortion."

Johnson's nomination seems contrary to this statement due to her brazen pro-abortion stances, including a Supreme Court amicus brief where she equated *forced pregnancy with "involuntary servitude." She has also written that "abortion restrictions 'reduce pregnant women to no more than fetal containers.'" She previously spoke against a Supreme Court decision to uphold a ban on partial birth abortion, as well.

In their letter, the Congressmen state that "it is important to recognize that Ms. Johnson has no interest in reducing the number of abortions." They ask, instead, for a "leader who will place the rule of law above political philosophy or personal agenda."

Co-signers include Akin, Bishop, Pence, Franks, Carter, Bartlett, Pitts, Hoekstra, Guthrie, Lummis, Fortenberry, Broun, Myrick, Lamborn, Schmidt, Shaddegg, Gingrey, Latta, Conaway, McCotter, Bilirakis, Bachmann, L.Smith, Thompson (PA), Taylor, Tiahrt, Westmoreland, Harper, Childer, Scalise, Foxx, C.Smith, Blackburn, Boener, Aderholt, Roe, Inglis, Cole, S. Johnson, Souder, Garrett, Boozman, J.Wilson, Manzullo, McHenry, Chaffetz.

CORRECTION: Originally, this post stated that Dawn Johnson called motherhood "involuntary servitude." This was incorrect. According to the Supreme Court amicus brief she authored, Johnson said "forced pregnancy" is "suggestive of involuntary servitude."
