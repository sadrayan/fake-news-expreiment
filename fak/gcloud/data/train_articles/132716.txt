The Ford Motor Company Fund and Community Services

The Ford Motor Company Fund and Community Services (or “the Ford Fund”) is a nonprofit organization responsible for the company’s philanthropic investments and volunteer efforts.

It is funded by contributions from Ford Motor Company. The goals of the Ford Fund today are the same as they were when Henry Ford II founded it 65 years ago: to support programs that effect meaningful change and improve the quality of life in the communities in which Ford does business.

Our three key community investment priorities: community life, education, driver safety.

We organize our community investment activities around our three strategic priorities: community life, education and driver safety. We developed these priorities to focus our efforts and intensify the benefits of our community investments. We also seek ways to help that will make the most of our financial contributions, as well as the unique skills of our company and employees. In 2014, we also continued to increase our focus on water-related projects in support of Ford’s overall water strategy.
