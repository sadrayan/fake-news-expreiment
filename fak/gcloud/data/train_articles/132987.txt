Ukrainians head to the polls for presidential elections
(CNN) Ukrainians were voting Sunday in the second round of presidential elections.

Television comedian and political newbie Volodymyr Zelensky was on track to cause a political upset, with recent polls, ahead of Sunday, suggesting an overwhelming lead over incumbent Petro Poroshenko.

Zelensky's entry in the presidential race came as a surprise, given that he is perhaps best known for his role in the Ukrainian comedy series "Servant of the People" as an out-of-luck schoolteacher who abruptly becomes president of Ukraine.

Despite his bid being initially dismissed as a protest vote and a joke, art may become reality after the 41-year-old challenger found support from an electorate tired of corruption and oligarchy.
