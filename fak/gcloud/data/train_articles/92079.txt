Perry says White release isn’t enough, report says Nebraska is ready to bolt and Jeff Wentworth is no Brian McCall fan.

(Happy birthday to Rep. Valinda Bolton.)

BULLETIN: Flash flood warning for northeastern Travis County and Williamson County until 7:45 a.m.

Looks like the staredown over tax returns and debates will continue in the governor’s race.

Republican Gov. Rick Perry has said he won’t debate until Democrat Bill White stops hiding his taxes. On Tuesday, White, who had already released his taxes for 2009, released them for all the years he was mayor. So now we can have a debate, right?

Not yet. Perry, who has released two decades’ worth of tax returns, says Texans should know how White was making his money when he was chairman of the Texas Democratic Party and when he was a high-level official in the U.S. Department of Energy. Will be interesting to see if either side flinches. It’s hard to imagine a gubernatorial campaign without a debate, but it seems like a real possibility here.

In the meantime, we have this interesting story from the AP’s Jay Root: “Former Houston Mayor Bill White, who was widely praised for guiding his city through Hurricane Rita, acknowledged to The Associated Press on Tuesday that he made money by investing in a company that was hired to help the region recover from the storm… Perry aides also pounced on the latest disclosures about White’s dealings with a company that played a role in the emergency response efforts during Hurricane Rita in September 2005. As the storm was walloping parts of Houston, White helped line up private companies to provide goods and services as part of a massive relief effort. One of those companies was Btec Turbines, where White had served on the board of directors before he was mayor. White said he called the company to help provide power generators to ensure the Houston-area refineries and the adjoining city of Baytown could maintain their water supply during the power outages. The company then got an emergency contract with the regional Coastal Water Authority, White recalled. A little more than a year later, White invested about $1 million in the privately held Btec, which has also provided generators to contractors in Iraq. He has reported about a $500,000 profit from the investment… ‘I though the company was good at what it did,’ White said. He said he considered keeping the water supply flowing to refineries a ‘matter of national importance.’ While acknowledging he has made money from Btec, White said he saw no conflict of interest in the arrangement.”

• From the Omaha World Herald: “An executive at a Big 12 school relayed to The World-Herald on Tuesday that he expects Nebraska to become a member of the Big Ten as early as Friday. NU Chancellor Harvey Perlman has declined all interviews about conference realignment and expansion. He is expected to address the topic with the Board of Regents at its Friday meeting in Lincoln.”

Baylor grad and state Rep. Jim Dunnam, D-Waco, told me Tuesday that, in deciding their next move if the Big 12 starts to fall apart, regents at Texas universities should make what’s best for the state their top priority.

“They’re trustees of an institution that is an integral part of the entire State of Texas,” Dunnam said.

Similarly, he said lawmakers shouldn’t just be looking out for their alma maters. And he questioned why the possible departure of one school (Nebraska or Missouri) would cause the rest of the Big 12 to go looking for other homes.

“I can’t imagine that the University of Texas and Texas A&M don’t have a significant say in their own future,” Dunnam said.

• Lots of good insight on the Big 12 maneuverings in this morning’s Kirk Bohls column: “Texas is not the villain here. If anybody, it’s Nebraska and Missouri, because they’ve openly flirted with the Big Ten and made it clear they’d leave the Big 12 in an instant. Texas has steadfastly made it known it wants to preserve the status quo, and why shouldn’t it, when it rules the roost? Maybe Texas could show good faith in the all-for-one department by agreeing to more equitable revenue sharing, but as one Big 12 athletic director told me, the other 11 schools agreed to this formula at the league’s inception, and it takes nine votes to change it… Make no mistake, Texas is the 600-pound gorilla in the room. If left to its own devices, it could join any conference it wishes today. But it is tethered to Texas A&M and Texas Tech, even though I’m told by people who know that there is a slight chance the state’s two top universities could separate, with Texas headed to the Pac-10 and A&M bent for SEC country. Not likely, but possible. With Dodds at the top, Texas may have more influence than any other school in the country. As one Big 12 athletic director told me recently, when asked if Texas could help determine who joins the Pac-10, ‘I’ve heard Texas is so extremely influential, it could bring Stephen F. Austin with them if it wants.’”

• I talked to House Administration Committee Chairman Charlie Geren on Tuesday about the new metal detectors at the Capitol. Specifically, I asked why Capitol employees don’t have to go through the metal detectors.

Geren pointed out that many Capitol employees enter the building from the underground parking garage — in other words, they don’t have to use the entrances that have metal detectors, so why make those who use those entrances go through the detectors?

So then, I asked, why not put metal detectors at those entrances also? “I feel very confident that none of my employees are going to come in and shoot somebody,” Geren said. I asked if that confidence extended to all Capitol employees, and he said it does. “Each representative is responsible for his or her employees.” He also said he thinks each lawmaker should decide whether their employees should endure criminal background checks.

• Yesterday I linked to a Houston Chronicle story that pointed out that students needed fewer right answers to pass some sections of the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills this year. Agency officials said the questions sometimes vary in difficulty from year to year, which is why the number of correct answers required varies.

Attached is a letter from the state’s testing company, Pearson, explaining how passing standards are set and vouching for the idea that this year’s test was just as difficult as last year. Also, the Statesman’s Laura Heinauer has a story this morning about the state’s pushback.

• Sen. Jeff Wentworth finished second to former Rep. Brian McCall when the Texas State University System Board of Regents chose a new chancellor. Let’s just say he’s not taking it well. Reeve Hamilton of the Texas Tribune reports , “Wentworth recently fired off a packet to Ron Blatchley, chairman of the Texas State Board of Regents, with a letter excoriating the decision, a side-by-side comparison of McCall’s and his resumes, letters of support from fellow legislators and other notables, and the minutes (which Wentworth finds questionable) from the meeting at which the decision was made. All this to make a point: Wentworth is ‘personally offended’ that ‘a loyal, tried and true, longtime member of the crew’ was thrown overboard in favor of ‘a Johnny-come-lately opportunist.’”

• The Statesman’s Ken Herman was on the board of the White House Correspondents Association when it wrestled with whether columnist Helen Thomas should keep her prized front-row seat in the briefing room. Herman recalls that debate in this morning’s column: “Questions about the briefing room seat, the only one with a person’s name on it, and not a news organization’s, came up while I was on the White House Correspondents Association board. Time had come, some said, to move Helen from the front row. There was no doubt that Helen’s questions/statements often were out of line. But there also was no doubt her long years of trailblazing service earned our respect. The choice was between looking heartless by moving her back or gutless by looking too weak to do what many thought was right. Helen voiced no objection to the potential move. I went with gutless, and we kept her front-row center. Nature, we told ourselves, would take care of the problem. In 2008, health issues kept Helen off the job for months. Many of us hoped she would fully recover and fully retire. She did and she didn’t.”

• Bob Garrett at the Dallas Morning News: “Legal aid lawyers today accused Texas of still running an illegally understaffed, inconvenient and confusing eligibility system for food stamps despite having worked off a backlog of pleas for help. ‘Plaintiffs are victims of the Kafkaesque bureaucracy that is the state of Texas food stamp program,’ lawyer Robert Doggett of Texas RioGrande Legal Aid said in a new filing in state district court in Travis County.”

• Anna Tinsley of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports that a Houston man who suggested the state Republican Party platform endorse a “sensible immigration policy” was not warmly received by some Republicans working on the party’s platform Tuesday. Meanwhile, a Southlake man hopes the platform will say a president’s parents must have been born in the United States. He said his goal is for Texas not to recognize an attempt by President Barack Obama to run for re-election.

• In an editorial, the Dallas Morning News says the public should know who paid for the collection of signatures that could pave the way for the Green Party to get on the statewide ballot. “The legality of the money behind the Green petitions needs to be tested in court. The secretary of state’s office will validate signatures but does not administer campaign-finance laws. Campaign finance is the purview of the Texas Ethics Commission, which typically investigates complaints and levies fines. Other scenarios that would root out the facts involve a civil action by Democrats or an investigation by the Travis County district attorney. Either way, the integrity of the finance laws must be ensured. The public has a right to know whose bank accounts influence Texas elections.”

• In something of a surprise, Blanche Lincoln won her runoff in Arkansas on Tuesday. Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post suggests this ad may have put her over the top. Also, in California, Republicans nominated former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman for governor and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina for U.S. Senate.

• A national poll from Gallup: “Gallup’s latest update on the generic ballot shows registered voters evenly divided in their current voting intentions for Congress, with 46 percent saying they would vote for the Republican candidate in their district and 46 percent for the Democratic candidate.”

• David Letterman on Rush Limbaugh’s recent wedding: “Right after the wedding, Rush consummated the cake.”
