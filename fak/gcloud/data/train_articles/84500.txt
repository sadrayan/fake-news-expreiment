Austin City Council proposes more meetings, changing public...
What we reported

The American-Statesman first examined the Austin City Council’s record of late meetings in June, after one meeting ended at 3:32 a.m. and several others had run past midnight. A follow-up story last month, based on a city auditor’s study, reported the average Austin City Council meeting ran 9 hours and 31 minutes, nearly three times longer than the average council meeting in several comparable cities.

What’s next

The public will be able to view and comment on the proposal on the city’s website at austintexas.gov and at a meeting on Jan. 22, with the time and place to be announced. The council could vote on an item related to the proposal at its first regular meeting Jan. 29 at City Hall.
