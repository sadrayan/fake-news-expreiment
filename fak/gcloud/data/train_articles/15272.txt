Steve Hicks, Vice Chairman Of The University Of The Texas Board Of Regents, Gave Abbott The Gift Of A “Travel Guide Membership.” According to the San Antonio Express-News, “Steven Hicks, vice chairman of the University of Texas Board of Regents, has donated $193,000 to Abbott and, along with his wife, Donna, gave the gift of a ‘travel guide membership’ in 2009.” Hicks was appointed to the Board in 2009. [The University of Texas System, Vice Chairman R. Steven Hicks; MD Anderson Cancer Center Profile; San Antonio Express-News, 3/01/14]

University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center received a $25.2 Million Grant From CPRIT In 2010; Transferred Award To CTNeT. According to the State Auditor, “The Statewide Clinical Trials Network of Texas (CTNeT) received a $25.2 million research grant from CPRIT even though CTNeT did not exist at the time the grant was awarded. The CTNeT grant was the largest single grant that CPRIT had awarded as of June 2012. CPRIT originally awarded the grant to the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in June 2010. Subsequent to the award, CTNeT was formed and registered to become a Texas-based non-profit company in August 2010 and CPRIT executed a grant agreement with CTNeT in September 2010. It is unclear what allowed CPRIT to transfer the award from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center to CTNeT. CPRIT also did not have documentation to support that the scientific review council recommended the original application for a grant.” [An Audit Report on Grant Management at the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas and Selected Grantees, January 2013]

MD Anderson Cancer Center did, which is part of the UT system. However, you'll note that's not part of the fact check we sent in the release. You just asked for additional gifts and I'm trying to give you as much information as possible. However, the ad specifically refers to Leininger

Zac:

Good morning.

I’m following up here with questions about the CPRIT ad. I’d be happy to hear back by email or phone.

Greg Abbott had a designee attend CPRIT meetings and, as you may know, his seat was one of 11 oversight committee slots, meaning he wasn’t CPRIT’s sole overseer. The AG’s office later helped Travis County gather information in advance of the CPRIT staff member’s felony indictment. The county’s district attorney said in January 2013 no board members were under investigation.

Separately, I have yet to confirm Leininger owned or had a stake in the Bryan-College Station company that got a grant. Aside from the Chronicle news story, does Davis have such evidence? The Dallas Morning News identified a Dallas man as the company’s owner.

Beyond the Leininger element, did any other Abbott donors have connections to entities drawing questionable grants and also shower him, as the ad says, with gifts or vacation trips? Please specify.

I hope to complete our review soon.

First, the ad doesn't say he was the "sole" overseer. It says he was "charged" with oversight.

Second, the ad never makes mention of an investigation, felony indictment or Abbott's role in either. It says Abbott was on the oversight committee, that his donors got tens of millions in grants without proper oversight and that Abbott was showered with gifts from donors who got grants.
