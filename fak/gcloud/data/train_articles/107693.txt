Cthulhu rising by DaShadeE
A cosmic horror emerging from the mist



EDIT: Since this painting has gone viral, with numerous people claiming all kinds of dumb shit about it, some clarifications are in order:

It is a freehand painting over a photo, done in Photoshop. The original photo was taken from Google, the location is a highway near Sofia, Bulgaria. As the original photo is not mine, I will refrain from selling this artwork.
