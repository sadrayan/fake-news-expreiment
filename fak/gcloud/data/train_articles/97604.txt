Get government assistance â€“ Refugees
Government-assisted refugees are Convention Refugees Abroad whose initial resettlement in Canada is entirely supported by the Government of Canada or Quebec. This support is delivered by IRCC-supported non-governmental agencies.

Support can last up to one year from the date of arrival in Canada, or until the refugee is able to support himself or herself, whichever happens first. It may include:

accommodation;

clothing;

food;

help in finding employment and becoming self-supporting; and

other resettlement assistance.

Organizations offering resettlement services to newcomers to Canada are called service provider organizations. There are various service provider organizations located throughout Canada working within the Resettlement Assistance Program.

The Canadian government offers financial assistance for government-assisted refugees and loans for all resettled refugees.

Urgent Protection Program (UPP)

The Urgent Protection Program (UPP) ensures that Canada is able to respond to urgent requests by refugees under threat of being returned home, of expulsion or of facing direct threats to their lives. UPP cases are designated as government-assisted refugees and some may be identified as Joint Assistance Sponsorship (JAS) cases. Learn more about the UPP .
