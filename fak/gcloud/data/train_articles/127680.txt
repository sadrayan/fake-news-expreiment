MN Woman Called 911 to Report Assault, Was Fatally Shot by Cops
A 40-year-old Australian woman was fatally shot by Minneapolis police on Saturday night after reporting an assault near her home. Authorities have confirmed that a Minneapolis police officer shot the woman, identified by friends as Justine Damond, but provided no details on what prompted the shooting. State investigators said the body cameras of the two police officers involved were turned off during the incident. The officers have been placed on paid leave. Three sources cited by the Minneapolis Star Tribune said Damond had approached a police squad car in the alley after phoning 911 to report a fight. She was speaking to the officer in the driver’s seat when the officer sitting on the passenger side shot her, the sources said. Damond’s son, Zach, told the Star Tribune he “demands answers” in the wake of the shooting. “Basically, my mom’s dead because a police officer shot her for reasons I don’t know,” he said.
