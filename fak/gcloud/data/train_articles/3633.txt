Tipper Gore in Nagano, Japan: Column 5
These moments help us remember why the Olympic Games are so special. There is a goodwill and spirit felt during the Games that transcends athletics. People from all nations come together in peace to compete on the field of play. Sadly, not all of the U.S. athletes who participated represented the best of our nation. The behavior of a few members of the U.S. men's ice hockey team has been a disappointment to us. They detract from the efforts and standards set by the other members of the team and all of the U.S. athletes who came here to compete and to experience the magic of the Olympic Games. But our nation is extremely proud of the athletes who competed here. The highlights of these Games will soon become part of Olympic history. Gary Allison, who traveled with our delegation, is capturing these stories in a series of chronicles known as The Olympic Century: The Official 1st Century History of the Modern Olympics. This 25-volume history reflects 18 years of research and 102 years of Olympic moments. Thank you Nagano for keeping the spirit alive.
