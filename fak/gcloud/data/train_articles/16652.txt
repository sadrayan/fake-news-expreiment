By now, I’m sure you realize that measures of school district finances and comparisons between districts are complex, numerous, and often can be used in misleading ways, both intentionally and unintentionally. It is for those reasons that the Legislature charged TEA with attempting to create more “transparency” in school funding, as spelled out in Rider #73 in the current general appropriations act:

“73. Public Education State Funding Transparency. Out of funds appropriated above to the Texas Education Agency, the agency shall evaluate, for the existing and prior four biennia, state aid provided through the Foundation School Program for school districts per student in average daily attendance and per student in weighted average daily attendance. In its evaluation, the agency shall compare state aid with the rate of inflation and other factors impacting school district costs. The agency shall report its findings to the Governor, the Legislative Budget Board, and the appropriate legislative education standing committees by January 1, 2018.

No later than January 1, 2019, the Texas Education Agency shall report on its external website the following information related to the Foundation School Program for fiscal years 2008 through 2018:

1. the average daily attendance for charter holders;

2. the average daily attendance for school districts;

3. local revenue for public education;

4. state aid for public education;

5. the amount of state aid provided per student in average daily attendance for school districts, represented in constant dollars;

6. the amount of state aid provided per student in average daily attendance for charter holders, represented in constant dollars;

7. the amount of recapture revenue, represented in constant dollars;

8. the total funding provided to school districts, represented in constant dollars.

Constant dollars should consider the rate of inflation and other factors impacting school district costs.”

With respect to what you have presented, I can make several observations:

The data at the link to the source material do not reflect the final 2016-17 data, but rather reflect the budgets adopted by the school districts prior to the beginning of the school year. Those budgets as reported to the state generally exclude a lot of federal funds. The most recent year for which TEA has final data is 2015-16 school year, which you can find at the following link: https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/school.finance/forecasting/financial_reports/1516_FinActRep.html . TEA will not have all final 2016-17 data reported until sometime next spring, likely in March 2018. The data presented reflect revenues, not expenditures. Spending can vary from revenues in a given year and result in a different ranking. The revenue amounts would include money for both operations and debt service. Depending on the point the data are supposed to support, this may be an appropriate combination, or it may not. The amounts per student are without regard to any variance in the educational needs of, or program participation of, the students in the listed districts. To the extent that the totals include debt service funds, and those debt service amounts vary considerably among districts, and may lead to different conclusions due to their inclusion. When looking at actual final revenues, the role of federal funds in the totals can be a significant factor to consider. Federal funds are generally restricted in their purposes, and generally cannot be used to maintain of construct facilities. Whether that is relevant to an argument about the ranking of a particular district depends on the characterization. I constructed the table below from the final 2015-16 revenue per student amounts shown in the link above:

2015-16 Total Revenue Per Student Rank 2015-16 Federal Revenue per Student 2015-16 State, Local and Intermediate Revenue per Student Rank Aldine 10,905 7 1,486 9,419 7 Arlington 10,171 12 811 9,360 9 Austin 10,805 8 1,302 9,503 6 Corpus Christi 10,216 11 1,264 8,952 12 Cypress-Fairbanks 10,395 10 763 9,632 5 Dallas 12,069 2 1,865 10,204 2 El Paso 10,906 6 1,906 9,000 11 Fort Worth 10,507 9 1,097 9,410 8 Houston 11,450 4 1,401 10,049 3 Katy 11,568 3 660 10,908 1 San Antonio 12,430 1 2,648 9,782 4 Ysleta 10,959 5 1,649 9,310 10

In this look at total revenue for 2015-16 (the measure chosen from the 2016-17 budget data), Austin ranks #8, but it ranks #6 after excluding federal funds.

Lastly, I don’t follow the adjustment in the placement of Dallas, or the statement that 2018 budget numbers were used. The numbers in the table in your email all appear to come from 2016-17 PEIMS budget information, as mentioned above. I don’t see any stated methodology for adjusting Dallas’ ranking, or any statement that other districts were subject to the same adjustment. What is “less proportional student loss”? Over what time period? What does that have to do with the facts?

As for whether Austin budgeted more total revenue per unadjusted/unweighted student than most large districts for 2016-17, I think the data you provided in your email would support such a claim, but that doesn’t seem to be the claim that was made. Whether Austin actually had more total revenue per unadjusted/unweighted student in 2016-17 is a fact that is not currently displayed in TEA’s PEIMS reports.
