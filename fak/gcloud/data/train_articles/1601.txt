US presenter Pat Robertson: ‘Force gay people to wear specially-coloured clothing’
Almost comically-homophobic televangelist Pat Robertson may have outdone himself: This time, he wants gay people to wear “specially-coloured clothes” as a way to distinguish them, reports Newslo.

The host of The 700 Club has been predicting that gay rights will bring God’s wrath upon America, resulting in “a massive financial collapse”, and now has now ventured an almost incomprehensibly offensive way of stopping the spread of disease: marking out homosexuals with specially-coloured clothes.

Referring to “lesbianism and homosexuality” as the causes of such a crisis, Robertson told a caller on his show earlier this week that “The only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.”

He continued: “I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-coloured clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official.

“That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said colour is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach.”

The caller pointed out that this echoed the yellow badges that Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany, but Robertson begged to differ.

He said, “I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps.”

Oh, Pat, you never fail to make us laugh. Now where can we get shirts that say “Deviant Sodomite”?
