Hannity Battles Muslim Cleric Anjem Choudary Over Islam VIDEO
Anjem Choudary, one of the Muslim clerics arrested in a counterterrorism raid, returned to Sean Hannity‘s show Monday night for another intense debate over Islam, ISIS, and whether he believes in the 72 virgins after you die.

Choudary declared that the media coverage of the ISIS beheadings has been “biased.” Hannity asked him if he would join ISIS. Choudary said he would “love to live under the sharia,” but his passport has been revoked since his arrest so he can’t leave the country.

Hannity then repeatedly pressed Choudary on whether he believes a Muslim will be greeted by 72 virgins when he dies, after killing himself and others. Choudary dismissed the idea of anyone killing innocents, but did tell Hannity someone who “sacrifices his life for the sake of Allah,” he will have everything he wants––not just 72 virgins––in the afterlife.
