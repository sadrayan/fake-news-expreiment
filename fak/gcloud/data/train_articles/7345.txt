Donald Trump questioned this morning Ted Cruz's father's connection to JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, highlighting a National Enquirer report on the subject.

"His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous," Trump said.

"Nobody even brings it up. They don't even talk about that. That was reported, and nobody talks about it."

The claim comes after the Enquirer report touted purported photos of Rafael Cruz alongside Oswald.

"What was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the shooting?" Trump asked.

Cruz dismissed Trump's claim this morning, mocking Trump for bringing up "tabloid trash."

"Yes, my dad killed JFK, he is secretly Elvis, and Jimmy Hoffa is buried in his backyard," he quipped.

Cruz argued that the Enquirer has now been used twice by Trump to attack his family and that the tabloid's CEO is a Trump backer.

"Donald was dismayed that the media wasn't repeating this latest idiocy, so he figured he'd have to do it himself," said Cruz.
