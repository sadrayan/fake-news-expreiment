Buck For Colorado
As a father of two, Ken believes in the value of life and is opposed to abortion except to protect the life of the mother. As U.S. Senator, Ken will oppose federal funding of abortion and will fight to protect the life of the unborn.



Ken believes life begins at conception, and does not favor doing away with common forms of birth control, like the pill.



It’s clear that Amendment 62 and personhood are being used interchangeably. This is not the case within the pro-life community--there are many people who favor the concept of personhood, but are opposed topersonhood amendments. Eagle Forum is one example. Eagle Forum is strongly pro-life, but they are stongly opposed to any type of personhood amendments. In Ken’s case, he supports the concept of personhood, but is not taking a position on any of the state ballot initiatives, including Amendment 62.
