Why Would We Give Corbett Four More Years? It's Time for a Fresh Start

Philadelphia, PA â€“ The Campaign for a Fresh Start today released a new ad that holds Tom Corbett accountable for cutting $1 billion from education while refusing to make oil and gas companies pay their fair share. Pennsylvania remains the only state in the country that does not charge a severance tax on natural gas.

"For more than three years, Tom Corbett has failed to offer real solutions to fund our schools and fix the state's stagnant economy," said Katie McGinty, Fresh Start chair. "After Corbett cut $1 billion from education, school districts across the state were forced to raise property taxes, and to make matters worse, we have fallen to 49th in job creation. Corbett's cuts also led to thousands of teachers being forced out of the classroom and increased class sizes. Tom Corbett's failed leadership has crippled our public schools and placed an unfair burden on middle-class families."

The Campaign for a Fresh Start highlights Corbett's failures in education and job creation in this new ad.

"It's a shame what Tom Corbett has done to Pennsylvania: huge deficits, while he's given tax breaks to big corporations. He's let oil and gas companies off the hook. Under Corbett, we're the only state in the company who doesn't charge an extraction tax. Corbett's cut a billion dollars from our schools, forcing communities to raise property taxes. And Pennsylvania ranks 49th in job creation. Tom Corbett: why would we give him four more years?"
