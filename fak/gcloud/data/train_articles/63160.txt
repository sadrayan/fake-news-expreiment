Senator Russ Feingold Says He Wants to Guarantee Social Security’s Future, but has Voted to Raise Taxes on Benefits in the Past
10/27/2015

(Madison, Wis.) – Senator Russ Feingold recently penned an Op-Ed in which he claims that it is his priority to protect Social Security for all recipients. This claim is in contradiction to his past actions while in the US Senate where he voted to raise taxes on the benefits received by senior citizens.1 When a vote was conducted to remove the tax increase from the budget, he voted against it.2 When asked about the vote, Senator Feingold replied “The president’s package does involve some pain in the Social Security area. I don’t enjoy voting for it, but I probably am going to vote for that part of his package that asks those who are on Social Security that already pay taxes on their Social Security, to pay a higher percentage. It’s only 20 percent.”3

“Senator Russ Feingold claims that Social Security is an untouchable program.” said Republican Party of Wisconsin Executive Director Mike Duffey. “He portrays himself to voters as a politician who is on their side, but Wisconsinites have learned that his actions do not match his words. While in Washington DC, Senator Feingold failed to practice what he preached and voted to increase taxes on senior citizens’ benefits.”
