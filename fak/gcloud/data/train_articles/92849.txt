State reviewing protocol after giving Bush email archive with sensitive information
The state is reviewing protocol after giving Jeb Bush a massive email archive that included some personal information from people who wrote to the former governor.

"The Department of State is currently reviewing our process for redacting confidential information from documents given to the State Archives," spokesman Mark Ard told the Tampa Bay Times in an email.

Ard did not respond to follow-up questions.

The issue arose after a technology blog noted that some of the 250,000 or so emails in Bush's archive, which he put online, contained some personal information, including at least some social security numbers. Bush has promised to redact any of the information but his lawyer last May explicitly requested the state strip out any sensitive details. (Background here.)

Though the burden rested with the state, the flap contributed to a two-fer of bad news for Bush, who is trying to show he is transparent and running a digitally savvy presidential campaign in waiting.

On Tuesday, Bush had to show the door to his new chief technology officer after offensive tweets and other remarks were uncovered.
