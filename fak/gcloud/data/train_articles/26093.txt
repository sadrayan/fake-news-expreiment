(1) Includes data for 36 states collectively known as the Federally-facilitated Marketplace. These 36 states include 27 states that have Marketplaces fully run by the federal government, 7 that have State Partnership Marketplaces, and 2 that have federally supported State-based Marketplaces in 2014.

(2) For the purposes of this analysis, an issuer represents a unique issuer identification number in the CMS Health Insurance Oversight System (HIOS). Because an entityâ€™s HIOS code is specific to each state, for purposes of this analysis, no issuer is counted as being active in more than one state.

(3) Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire, and West Virginia are State Partnership Marketplaces for 2014.

(4) Idaho and New Mexico are federally supported SBMs for 2014 and utilize the FFM eligibility and enrollment platform.
