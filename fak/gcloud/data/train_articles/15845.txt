Well, without seeing the rest of what he said, I think it would be better if it started with "Some of these are people . . . ", but it is definitely true -- The Border Patrol apprehends people from all parts of the world who are paying smugglers to cross illegally into the United States, including people from countries with connections to terrorism.

For example, looking in an ICE database that I obtained through FOIA of all their 2013 removal cases, with a quick search I was able to find a handful of cases of aliens who had been arrested by the Border Patrol who were citizens of countries linked to terrorism and had crossed the border illegally from Mexico recently. There were 2 from Nigeria, 3 from Pakistan, 1 from Egypt, 1 from Morocco and 1 from Afghanistan. All were between the ages of 26 and 50. That's just the ones who were turned over to ICE, not counting any that might have been processed by the Border Patrol. Jessica

What's your analysis of the second part of Gov. Perry's statement per OTMs: "These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations."
