Transcript:

Now that I’ve got your attention…

My name is Jeanne Ives and I’m the conservative Republican running against Bruce Rauner for Governor.

I’m an economic liberty, pro-family West Point grad.

I’ve spent the last five years battling Chicago Democrats.

I didn’t think I’d have to spend so much time battling Bruce Rauner.

But when Rauner betrayed conservative families, that’s exactly what I did.

Rauner made Illinois a sanctuary state. I voted against it.

Rauner made you pay for abortions in all nine months of pregnancy. I voted against it–and so did every other Republican legislator.

Rauner took money from your schools to bail out the Chicago Public Schools. I voted against it.

National Review has called Rauner the worst Republican governor in the country, because he is.

Rauner betrayed us.

I honor who we are as conservatives.

Rauner can’t win re-election.

He said he’s not in charge.

With your help, I’ll lead the charge.
