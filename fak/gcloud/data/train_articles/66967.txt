Trump said during an appearance on Fox News's "The O'Reilly Factor" that the Chinese leader should be given fast food instead of a meal prepared by a White House chef.

"I would not be throwing him a dinner. I would get him a McDonald’s hamburger and say we’ve got to get down to work because you can’t continue to devalue," Trump said.

"We’ll give him a state dinner and what he has done is suck all the jobs, suck all the money right out of our country," he said. "I'd give him probably a double-size Big Mac."

Challenged by host Bill O'Reilly, the celebrity real estate tycoon doubled down on what has become a main issue in his campaign, criticizing the U.S. government for allowing China to devalue its currency.

Trump said he would put a tariff on Chinese products, saying "you have to" have a trade war.

"Their leaders are intelligent, ours aren't," Trump said Monday.

Another GOP rival, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, earlier Monday called on President Obama to cancel Jinping's visit amid a major drop in Chinese stocks rippled around the world, including the U.S.

"I'd get along with him very well," Trump said of Jinping.
