Obama Interview Lifts Fox News’ ‘O’Reilly Factor’ to Largest Audience in 10 Months
Building off the momentum of his at-times-testy interview with President Obama one day earlier, Bill O’Reilly drew strong ratings for his return to “The O’Reilly Factor” on Monday night.

Nielsen estimates that 4.204 million watched “The O’Reilly Factor” — up about 1 million from the previous Monday and the largest for any installment of the show since last April. The hour included roughly 10 minutes more of footage from the host’s live sit-down with the President, which aired prior to Fox’s broadcast of Super Bowl XLVIII on Sunday.

The FNC program regularly beats its cable news competition, and it especially dominated on Monday by drawing about three times the combined tune-in for MSNBC’s Chris Hayes (940,000) and CNN’s Anderson Cooper (453,000). O’Reilly also drew more viewers in the key news demo of adults 25-54 than the other shows combined (626,000 vs. 457,000).

The strong start to this week for Fox News comes on the heels of its first-place primetime finish among cable networks last week. Boosted by the State of the Union address and coverage surrounding it, FNC averaged 2.3 million viewers in primetime — ahead of cable biggies like USA (2.2 million) and ESPN (2.1 million).
