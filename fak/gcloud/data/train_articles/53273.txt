Hey Reddit! I am Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, US Candidate for Congress in NY-14. I worked for the late Sen. Kennedy, left politics to be an educator, social entrepreneur, waitress, then Bernie organizer
Hello there, r/SandersforPresident, aka the reason I stopped lurking on Reddit! UPDATE: This has been an amazing AMA experience!

I'll be following up throughout the day should more questions come through. Be sure to check out /r/BrandNewCongress, /r/JusticeDemocrats, and Ocasio2018. Donate, sign up to canvass, or get a fancy new Ocasio2018 shirt. Purple is a universally flattering color.

My name is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and I am running for US Congress in NY-14 (Bronx and Queens). My campaign is challenging Joseph Crowley, one of the most Corporate-funded members of Congress, on an entirely progressive and grassroots campaign. I am running as a part of Brand New Congress, a post-partisan progressive effort to mount dozens of primary challenges in the 2018 midterm elections.

In just 3 weeks since launching, we've:

Pressured the incumbent to cosponsor HR676: Medicare for All

Organized the 2nd most donors in two weeks than any NYC campaign in six months, and

Colleced 5 major organizational endorsements in the first three weeks of our campaign.

Grassroots organizing will save America. HELP US WIN THIS THING.

Ask me anything about running for Congress, the NY-14 race, Brand New Congress, going to Flint, MI and Standing Rock, working in the hospitality industry, being painfully bad at League of Legends, horses and ducks, etc.
