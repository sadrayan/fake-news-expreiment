GOP site selection team gets elephant’s-eye view of Dallas
In the contest for the next Republican presidential convention, Dallas could be emerging as the elephant in the room.

Big. Bold. Impossible to ignore.

Featuring two live pachyderms — and cheerleaders, celebrities, top-end food, musical performances, fireworks and confetti — city leaders Thursday rolled out their most extravagant red carpet yet for the GOP brass who will pick the site of the massive event.

The other contenders — Cleveland, Denver and Kansas City — also have played up their attractions to woo the Republicans visiting over the last two weeks. And though Dallas’ bid isn’t perfect, city officials are serving a heady mix of flash and substance.

“Dallas does it big,�? said Enid Mickelsen, the GOP’s site selection committee chief. “What can I say?�?

City officials even revealed the high-profile framework of how its convention would operate, a signal of the power and tenacity of their efforts.

Dallas businessman Ray Washburne, the GOP’s national finance chairman, would serve as the host committee’s official chairman. Organizers also said they were in discussions to hire former Dallas City Manager Mary Suhm as the committee’s executive director.

And while GOP leaders were careful not to name a favorite city, they did little to dampen Dallas officials’ enthusiasm.

GOP Chairman Reince Priebus said he had nary a concern about the city’s plans, adding that he wasn’t “just trying to be nice.�? Though he said he would prefer a June convention — a date that Dallas can’t accommodate because of potential conflicts at American Airlines Center — he said the total package has to be considered.

“I would use the June 27 date if everything were equal,�? he said, pointing to each city’s pros and cons. “But it’s not equal.�?

The local team, led by the Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau, won’t receive more definitive feedback for at least another week or two.

That’s when the committee will have a conference call and evaluate its recent trips. The group could name a lone finalist. It could cut a couple of cities. Or it could do nothing.

The full Republican National Committee is expected to vote in August, when the party holds its summer meetings in Chicago.

Dallas’ strengths

The four-day nominating convention in 2016 is projected to attract 50,000 visitors, bringing along a sizable economic boost and an international media spotlight. Critics say such events don’t pack the promised economic punch but do pose security risks and traffic hassles.

But whether or not Dallas wins the bid, the GOP’s decision will mark the conclusion of a mad scramble to get the city in contention.

Mickelsen recalled that Phillip Jones, the visitors bureau’s CEO, visited with Republican officials several months back and asked all sorts of questions. She remembered thinking, “Great guy. Great city. But they are starting a little too late.�?

“But no you didn’t,�? she said Thursday. “Dallas has come through magnificently.�?

The strength of Dallas’ proposal sits in its vast hotel stock, its fundraising muscle and an arena that officials say was built to host a national political convention.

About 80 percent of 16,000 hotel rooms reserved for the convention are within four miles of American Airlines Center. The city has $45 million of the necessary $60 million lined up, with $25 million from the state’s major events fund and $20 million in donor pledges.

The AAC presents a timing problem, as the NBA and NHL schedules preclude it from being an option for the preferred June 27 date.

But except for Kansas City, the other contenders are dealing with the same complication. Though officials flirted with the idea of holding the event at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, they are pitching the arena instead as an ideal spot for a July 18 convention.

And the city’s proposed personnel plan for the convention — putting Washburne and Suhm in key spots — seems to bolster those strengths.

Washburne, who attended Thursday’s events, has access to deep, deep pockets. And Suhm, who couldn’t be reached for comment, brings “years of experience working with every division of the city and working closely with the business community,�? Jones said.

‘We like to win’

Dallas also seems to be riding high on the enthusiasm — a word used repeatedly by GOP officials — that’s allowed bid organizers to accomplish the seemingly impossible task of one-upping their pitch at every turn.

In March, Dallas officials presented their official bid in a book encased in metal. In April, they treated Republicans on the “technical�? site visit — supposedly a low-key fact-finding mission — to Pecan Lodge barbecue and accommodations at the Hilton Anatole. That’s where Ronald Reagan stayed when he was renominated for president in 1984, Dallas’ first political convention.

In May, they brought along two Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders to the GOP’s spring meetings in Memphis, Tenn.

And this week, the charm offensive went into overdrive.

“We like to win,�? Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told the GOP officials. “It’s as simple as that.�?

Rowdy, the Dallas Cowboys’ mascot, welcomed the crew at the airport. Voicemails from Big Tex awaited the GOP officials at their rooms at the Ritz Carlton. And country star Pat Green headlined a party Wednesday at his Uptown hot spot, The Rustic.

There was breakfast at Savor at Klyde Warren Park and lunch at Cloud Nine, where desserts were shaped like Reunion Tower. Oil baron Ray Hunt hosted a reception at the Hunt Oil Building, and real estate magnate Harlan Crow hosted one at his home. Both are big Republican donors.

Two live elephants — Suse and Esa, from Oklahoma — welcomed the GOP convention scouts to the AAC on Thursday morning. As did a crowd of cheering volunteers. As did cheerleaders for the Dallas Mavericks and Dallas Stars. As did the Kilgore College Rangerettes. As did Dallas’ Salvation Army band.

Linda Gray, who plays Sue Ellen Ewing on Dallas old and new, surprised the entourage at a luncheon. And Jerry Jones arranged for the Cowboys’ team buses to take the group to AT&T Stadium, which is still being considered for opening or closing ceremonies.

The city’s organizers also gave the Republicans a taste of what a Dallas 2016 convention would look like.

State signs with the party’s elephant mascot stood in the AAC’s lower bowl, matching the home states of the top officials in attendance. Videos played of Reagan’s acceptance speech from the Dallas convention. And live vocalists performed a rousing song about Dallas.

Then came the balloons. Then came the confetti. Then came the fireworks.

Asked later to list Dallas’ top attribute, aside from passion, Mickelsen just laughed.

“Setting aside the enthusiasm?�? she said. “How do you not notice the enthusiasm?�?

What’s next?

Now that the GOP scout team has completed its visit of the four cities — Dallas, Denver, Cleveland and Kansas City, Mo. — the party is expected to pick a winner by this fall to host the 2016 presidential convention.
