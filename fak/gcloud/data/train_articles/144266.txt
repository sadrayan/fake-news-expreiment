Chris Voigt Ends Potato-Only Protest Diet: Why?
(CBS/AP) After 60 days, Chris Voigt's great potato crusade has come to an end.

The head of the Washington State Potato Commission ended his highly publicized, spud-only diet on Monday, lighter by 21 pounds and probably sick of fries.

Voigt started the diet October 1 to publicize his opposition to federal proposals to bar or limit potatoes in some government food programs. Potatoes are the only vegetable not allowed for purchase under the federal Women, Infants and Children program.



"If we are successful in convincing U.S. Department of Agriculture to put potatoes in the programs, then I'd call it a 100 percent success," Voigt said of his diet.

Halfway through the diet, stories surfaced that Voigt was giving up. But he countered on his blog, writing, "You may have seen these wild rumors about me floating around the internet and media that I have quit my 60-day diet and went on a drunken rampage with Charlie Sheen! None of it is true!"

What is true is that Voigt and his family celebrated a potato-only Thanksgiving, consisting of five pounds of mashed spuds shaped into a turkey, basted with olive oil and broiled. No word on how the "tur-tato" tasted, but Voigt told Reuters "it was tender."

What impact did the diet have on Voigt's health? He said his weight dropped from 197 pounds to 176 pounds and his cholesterol level fell 67 points. His doctor was shocked, Voigt said.

But his doctor also advised Voigt to go slow reintroducing other foods into his diet.

Voigt's first big meal Tuesday? Tacos, fajitas, and fruit.



And, oh yes, grilled potatoes.
