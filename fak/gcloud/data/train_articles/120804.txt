Trump brags about the national debt, but his comparison is misleading
President Trump suggests his supporters should hold their own rally and says it would be "the biggest of them all."

Maybe the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN should have their own rally. It would be the biggest of them all! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017

It's not clear exactly what prompted his comment, but it came a day after a star-studded crowd of nearly 2,000 protesters gathered outside the Beverly Hills headquarters of United Talent Agency for a rally against the policies of Trump's administration.

The tweet prompted a sharp response from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who shared a pair of side-by-side photos that appear to show the crowd at Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration compared with that at the Women's March on Washington, a protest against Trump's presidency that took place a day later.
