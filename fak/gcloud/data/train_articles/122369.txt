Swedish man gets disability benefits after his heavy metal obsession is declared an 'addiction'
A Swedish man is now able to claim disability benefits after his heavy metal obsession was declared an 'addiction'.Roger Tullgren, 42, had consulted a number of doctors who testified that his obsession had indeed become an addiction, meaning he was unable to hold down a full-time job, reports Swedish news site Local, via Global Post

"I have been trying for 10 years to get this classified as a handicap," said Tullgren, who sports tattoos and long black hair, according to the article, and attended almost 300 gigs last year. "I spoke to three psychologists and they finally agreed that I needed this to avoid being discriminated against." He currently has a part time job as a dishwasher at a restaurant in Hassleholm, but this will be supplemented by disability benefits.His new boss reportedly will let Tullgren wear what he wants to work and give him time off for gigs, as well as letting him play music as he works. "I signed a form saying: 'Roger feels compelled to show his heavy metal style. This puts him in a difficult situation on the labour market. Therefore he needs extra financial help'. So now I can turn up at a job interview dressed in my normal clothes and just hand the interviewers this piece of paper," commented Tullgren.
