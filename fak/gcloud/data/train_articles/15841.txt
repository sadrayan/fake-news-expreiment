Subject: Fresh query

Lauren:

The other day, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told was addressing reporters before the start of the special session and said: “Of all the money we spend on education, less than 32 percent goes to teachers.”

Alejandro Garcia in Patrick’s office offered this TEA web link: http://tea.texas.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=51539613257

The link does not work for me so far.

My query: What evidence or data does the TEA have available that would speak to the accuracy of this claim?

Any other recommended resources?

THANKS.

You were provided the 2016 Pocket Edition file, which downloads as a PDF, but there are a couple of easier reports for you.

The total revenue figure of 58,796,907,294 comes from this report (2016 Actual Financial Report) – See line 1, Total Revenue, All Funds: https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/cgi/sas/broker?_service=marykay&_program=sfadhoc.actual_report_2016.sas&_service=appserv&_debug=0&who_box=&who_list=_STATE

For 2015-2016, the statewide teacher base pay of $18,023,516,741 is available in our Staff FTE Counts and Salary Report (choose 2015-2016 school year and statewide totals): https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/adhocrpt/adpeb.html

(We do not keep total teacher pay – which includes stipends – in a report online, but that figure for 2015-2016 is $19,005,561,634.)

Let us know if you need anything else.
