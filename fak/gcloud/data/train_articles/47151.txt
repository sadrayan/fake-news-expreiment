Suspect in Stockholm Attack Was an ISIS Recruit, Uzbek Official Says
The statement by the Uzbek foreign minister, Abdulaziz Kamilov, was the first public indication that Mr. Akilov might have been doing the bidding of the Islamic State. Many Swedes have been asking how Mr. Akilov, who last year was denied asylum and was ordered to leave the country, managed to elude the authorities’ grasp.

Mr. Kamilov said that Mr. Akilov was born in 1978 in Samarkand, in central Uzbekistan. He traveled to Stockholm in 2014 to work on construction sites.

“During the time he spent abroad, he was recruited by emissaries of international terror organization Islamic State,” Mr. Kamilov said of Mr. Akilov. “According to the information available, he actively encouraged his fellow nationals to travel to Syria and to fight alongside Islamic State.

“He repeatedly sent propagandist videos with terror content to his relatives and other contacts in Uzbekistan,” Mr. Kamilov added, “trying to induce them to commit acts of violence against representatives of public authority, leadership and law enforcement of Uzbekistan.”
