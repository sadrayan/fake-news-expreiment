Office of the Governor - Scott Walker
Working for Wisconsin’s Families, Farmers, Seniors, and Small Businesses

This week, I signed a bill bringing $100 million in property tax relief to Wisconsin’s families, farmers, seniors, and small businesses. With this bill, the typical Wisconsin homeowner will save approximately $680 over four years.

Over the past few years, we’ve had to make tough, but prudent, decisions in order to address the source of Wisconsin’s financial problems. We enacted structural reforms helping to build a stronger financial foundation for Wisconsin’s future. This investment in property tax relief comes from higher than expected growth in state revenue due to our growing economy and job creation. As a result of our wise fiscal management, the State of Wisconsin also spent less money than anticipated in the last fiscal year.

In the decade prior to our taking office, property taxes on a median-valued home skyrocketed by 27 percent. Now, families, farmers, seniors, and small businesses can breathe a sigh of relief for the third year in a row because of our commitment to lowering taxes and fiscal responsibility.

I would like to thank Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos for their leadership, as well as Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature for their overwhelming bipartisan support of this meaningful property tax relief.

Our reforms are allowing us to invest in Wisconsin’s priorities, making it truly one of the greatest states for families and businesses to call home.
