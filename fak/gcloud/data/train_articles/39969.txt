Girl Scout Cookies can be purchased from girls participating in the Girl Scout Cookie Program® only and during your local council’s cookie season. To find cookies, learn when cookie season starts in your community, and locate cookie sale booths, enter your zip code in the Find Cookies! search box.

You can also call or email your local Girl Scout council. Its phone number(s), website, Facebook page, and Twitter account are all on the Council Finder page. Council staff or volunteers can work to help you find a cookie booth or a Girl Scout troop near you. A council conducts only one cookie sale per year. Most cookie sales take place between January and April, but some occur as early as September.

Finally, try our free mobile Girl Scout Cookie Finder app for your iOS or Android device. You can search for cookie sales in your neighborhood, get details on your favorite Girl Scout Cookies, and use social media to tell your friends.
