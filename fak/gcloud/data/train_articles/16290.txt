Gardner,

Here is the latest Facts & Figures for the Texas Medical Center. To clarify, the numbers I gave you before were pulled from responses to the survey for 2011, but not every member institution has responded. Below are the numbers from the 2010 survey, to which every institution responded. I hope that makes sense.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,

Lisa

Unfortunately, we do not currently have a breakdown of physicians, nurses, and researchers for our most current data; only the total number of employees. We are in the process of collecting new data and should have a breakdown within the next month....

Kind Regards,

First. While we have not done traditional research into the ranking of the Texas Medical Center, we have met with delegations from more than 100 countries and 50 of the largest U.S. cities. All of these groups have asked how they can create an organization that compares to the Texas Medical Center.

In the process of exchanging information with these groups, we have found that none have medical assets as concentrated as is the case with the Texas Medical Center. If you look at size alone, the Texas Medical Center is the 9th largest downtown area in the U.S. If you look at patient visits, the Texas Medical Center had 7.1 million (2010 survey). Compare this to John Hopkins (http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/downloads/FastFacts_JHM.pdf), which has about 2.8 million outpatient encounters. Or the Mayo Clinic (http://www.mayoclinic.org/about/facts.html), which as 1,113,000 total clinic patients.

We are working to update our facts and figures; but unfortunately, this will not be finished in time for your deadline.

I hope I have helped.

Thank you,

Thanks. Does any of the information in your email below resolve whether Houston (or the center alone) is home to the most doctors, nurses and researchers in the world? If so, please specify/elaborate.

Separately, I found a US Census table indicating that in 2004 Harris County had 11,419 physicians, which was the fourth-highest total nationally behind California’s Los Angeles County (30,102 physicians); Illinois’s Cook County, home to Chicago (21,189); and New York County (19,849). Meantime, Harris County’s 2004 ratio of 314 physicians per 100,000 residents was lower than the ratios in 10 other populous counties, including another Texas county. New York County led with 1,248 physicians per 100,000 persons, followed by San Francisco (838); Philadelphia (498); Marion County, home to Indianapolis (476); Cook and California’s Santa Clara counties (398 each); Ohio’s Franklin County, home to Columbus (387); Bexar County in Texas, home to San Antonio (375); San Diego (350); and Florida’s Duval County, home to Jacksonville (348). Eight additional Texas counties--topped by Galveston County, home to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, with 514 physicians per 100,000 persons--had more physicians per 100,000 residents than Harris County. They were Kendall (592); Gillespie (444); Bell (437); Lubbock (416); Smith (406); Potter (380); and Bowie (322), according to the table.

I’m not sure how else we can help you. I believe the information we provided shows just what a massive operation the Texas Medical Center is. With 54 member institutions, more than 7.1 million annual patient visits, about 100,000 employees, and almost 7,000 hospital beds, I do not believe there is a medical complex that remotely compares in the entire world.

Thank you,
