Town Hall Meetings
I have always made holding public, in-person town hall meetings a top priority. Hearing directly from you is important. In fact, during the last two years, I am proud to report I have held the most town hall meetings of any member of Congress.



Because these public meetings throughout the Fifth Congressional District have been a cornerstone of my career, I want to update you on their status for 2019. By way of background, you may know, six years ago I tripped over a coiled power cord and broke my hip while attending a fair in Butler. After a surgical repair, and a few weeks of healing, I was fully able to resume my duties. However, I always knew this repair was only a temporary fix.



Unfortunately, my hipâ€™s condition has deteriorated recently and, my doctors are now recommending a full hip replacement. I will undergo this surgery in January after the swearing-in of the new Congress. It is anticipated my recovery and rehab therapy will take several weeks. Therefore, I am postponing the scheduling of additional town hall meetings until early spring. I expect to make a full recovery, and, I will be working hard to get back on my feet as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I appreciate your understanding of the delayed town hall meeting schedule and ask that you continue to communicate with me through telephone calls, letters, and emails.



All indications are my work will continue without a hitch during my recovery, despite my temporary, limited mobility. Thank you for support and patience. I look forward to seeing you at a town hall meeting later in 2019.
