Minneapolis: Developer scraps plan to close two streets for project near stadium
In a presentation to members of the Minneapolis Planning Commission on Thursday, representatives of local developer Ryan Cos. told commissioners Thursday that they were no longer looking at closing Park and Portland avenues as part of a $400 million mixed-use development in the city's downtown.

Rick Collins, vice president of development for Ryan, said the company analyzed four different scenarios under which Park and Portland could be modified to reduce the flow of traffic as part of an alternative urban areawide review study but ultimately decided to scrap all of them.

Another modification to the Ryan proposal was the addition of a 125-unit apartment complex on the western edge of the public park facing Fifth Avenue.

The proposed development would transform five blocks of downtown Minneapolis property, which is currently owned by the Star Tribune and dominated by surface parking lots.

In addition to the two-block park and 125-unit apartment complex, the development would include a pair of 20-story commercial and residential towers and a parking ramp.

The development is intended to complement the planned new Vikings stadium on the Metrodome site and is expected to be completed in time for the 2016 football season.
