Charlotte holds vigil for the violence coming out of Charlottesville
- Hundreds of people joining together as one voice to go against the hate that's been coming out of Charlottesville, Virginia

"What that man did with his car shows by driving into over 100 people showed that he was capable of hate. He was capable of hurting people and it's just wrong," Indivisible Charlotte organizer Scott Huffman said.

"I’m heart broken. I continue to wake up and be more horrified and more horrified and the only solace that I feel I can grasp onto is by being around other people," Kim Wylie said.

Many here telling FOX 46 they are just seeing a continuous cycle of hate.

"I grew up in an era of racism and it seems like we were going in one direction to get rid of that and now it's being reversed," Beth Stuart said

Being at the park with so many other, they find hope within each other by peacefully spreading their messages of love, justice and inclusion.

Other telling FOX 46, showing up to vigils like these is half the battle to combat the hate.

"You have to show up. You have to show that we are here. And that we are vastly larger than the hate that is filling up this country," Wylie said.

"You see all these people? You don't see anybody hollering and cussing and raising canes. We are all sitting here peacefully, wanting their thoughts and ideas heard and they are doing it in a peaceful manner. If a Neo-Nazi wants to sit beside me, fine, as long as he shows me respect and I’ll show him respect but when they start to talk about hurting people, talk violence, talk evil, talk hate. It's not acceptable," Maxine Goodwin said.

The NAACP will be hosting a "Stop the hate Rally," Monday, August 14th at 2 p.m. It is being held at the Little Rock AME ZIon Church located on 401 N. McDowell Street.
