As for Uber numbers --

The number of drivers constantly fluctuates but is largely based on the time of year and when people want to drive. Many people come onto the platform just to make extra money in December for holiday gifts, or drive only during SXSW or ACL. Those folks are not included in the original numbers I gave you.

Some are in between jobs and only drive for a few weeks to a few months. Some take one trip, and decide it is not for them. Some take one trip, and love it, and decide to continue driving for the rest of the year.

The background checks are annual, so if they do decide to keep driving, the screening is repeated.

The “nearly 50,000” number is the number of people that have gone through the Uber screening process in the last year. Many of them do not pass the screening.

That does NOT include Lyft drivers that are vetted through their process, so we would expect the number to be much higher than 50,000.
