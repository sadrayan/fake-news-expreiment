N.J. colleges expect tuition increases after Christie's budget cuts $173M
New Jersey's colleges are expecting tuition increases, fewer faculty hires and scholarship program cuts after Gov. Chris Christie proposed a $173 million cut in state aid to higher education, a report in the Philadelphia Inquirer said.

The 7.7 percent cut in funding would come after $62 million was already cut for this year, according to the report. Four-year public colleges would get 17.7 percent less funding, and county colleges would get an 8.6 percent cut, the report said. The state ranks 33rd in state funding for higher education per capita in 2008-09, according a survey compiled by the University of Illinois.
