ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR OUR VETERANS. (a) In General.--Chapter 55 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ``Sec. 5511. Conditions for treatment of certain persons as adjudicated mentally incompetent for certain purposes ``(a) In General.--Beginning on the date of enactment of this section, in any case arising out of the administration by the Secretary of laws and benefits under this title, the Secretary shall not determine a person to be adjudicated as a mental defective under subsection (d)(4) or (g)(4) of section 922 of title 18 unless the Federal Government has met the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the person is a danger to self or others. The process to determine whether such person is a danger to self or others, as set forth in this section, shall be separate from the Department's process to determine a person mentally incompetent for the purposes of assigning a fiduciary. A person that is subject to the process that may result in a finding that he or she is a danger to self or others shall be provided formal notice and a process by which to challenge the Federal Government's position, and shall be provided written notice of the effect of the ruling with respect to their ability to own and possess firearms and the protections granted under this section. ``(b) Medical Review.-- ``(1) In general.--The process by which a person may be determined to be a danger to self or others shall be initiated, with the exception of those persons described in subsection (i)(1), only after 2 health care professionals of the Department conclude, based on clear and convincing medical evidence, that the person is a danger to self or others. ``(2) Limitation.--If a conclusion by 2 health care professionals of the Department that a person is a danger to self or others is not made in accordance with paragraph (1) , the Federal Government may not begin the process to find that such person is a danger to self or others. ``(c) Process.--If a conclusion that a person is a danger to self or others is made under subsection (b)(1), not later than 30 days after that date on which such conclusion is made, the Department shall provide notice to the person, in writing, of the medical finding, the rights and protections afforded by this section, and the effect of a future administrative or judicial ruling with respect to the ability of the person to own and possess firearms. ``(d) Administrative Review.--(1) Except as provided in subsection (i), not later than 60 days after the date on which a person described in subsection (a) receives notice of the pendency of the Federal Government action to determine whether or not such person is a danger to self or others, such person may request a review by the board designed or established under paragraphs (2) and (3) or a court of competent jurisdiction to determine whether such person is a danger to self or others. If such person does not specify a forum, the Federal Government shall choose the forum. In such assessment, the board may consider the person's honorable discharge or decoration and other mitigating factors. ``(2) Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary shall designate or establish a board that shall, upon request of a person under subsection (a), make a determination after both parties have presented their case as to whether a person is a danger to self or others. If the board determines that the Federal Government failed to prove that the person is a danger to self or others, the person shall not be required to present his or her case. ``(3) The board shall consist of 3 former or current Federal judicial officers for a term of two years each and a majority decision shall control. ``(4) A determination by the board designated or established under paragraphs (2) or by a court of competent jurisdiction that a person does not meet the standard under subsection (f) shall preclude the Secretary from reporting such person to the National [[Page S4555]] Instant Criminal Background Check System for the purpose of prohibiting the acquisition, receipt, transfer, shipment, transportation, or possession of firearms or ammunition. ``(5) Not later than 90 days after the date on which the person or Federal Government chooses the administrative review process, the board shall make a determination. If the board does not make a determination within the required 90- day period, the Secretary shall not report the person to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System for the purpose of prohibiting the acquisition, receipt, transfer, shipment, transportation, or possession of firearms or ammunition. ``(e) Judicial Review.--Not later than 45 days after the date on which an assessment of a person under subsection (d) is made, such person or the Federal Government may file a petition for judicial review of the board's determination with a court of competent jurisdiction. Such court shall review the case de novo. ``(f) Burden of Proof.--The burden of proof for all actions arising under this section shall be on the Federal Government to prove, based on clear and convincing evidence, that a person is a danger to self or others and such burden shall be met before the person may be adjudicated as a mental defective under subsection (d)(4) or (g)(4) of section 922 of title 18. ``(g) Emergency Order.--(1) In the case of a person who the Secretary believes may be an imminent danger to self or others, the Secretary may file an emergency petition in a court of competent jurisdiction to seek a temporary order prohibiting the acquisition, receipt, transfer, shipment, transportation, or possession of firearms or ammunition, if the Secretary has already transmitted the notification letter described in subsection (c). The court in which such action is filed may, if the court finds probable cause exists that a person is an imminent danger to self or others, grant such petition. The Secretary shall submit to the court the information and documents, in unredacted form, that support the Secretary's position. ``(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), an emergency order issued under this subsection shall expire on the earlier of-- ``(A) the date that is 90 days after the date on which the order is issued; or ``(B) the date on which a determination is made by the board established under subsection (d)(2) or a court of competent jurisdiction as to whether the person is a danger to self or others. ``(3) The court may, in its discretion, extend an order issued under this subsection for a reasonable amount of time. ``(h) Regulatory Changes.--Consistent with the requirements imposed under this section, the Secretary shall review all relevant regulations and revise such regulations as necessary. ``(i) Persons With Existing Records.--(1) For persons with existing records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System database supplied by the Secretary as of the date of enactment of this section, not later than 90 days after such date of enactment, the Secretary shall provide written notice of the opportunity for administrative review or judicial review consistent with this section. ``(2) Each person described in paragraph (1) may, at any time, request administrative review under subsection (d) or judicial review by a court of competent jurisdiction to challenge the placement of the person in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System database consistent with the procedures set forth in this section. If such person does not specify a forum, the Federal Government shall choose the forum. In such assessment, the board may consider the person's honorable discharge or decoration and other mitigating factors. ``(3) In an action under this subsection, the failure of the Federal Government to prove, based on clear and convincing evidence, that a person is a danger to self or others consistent with the procedures in this section shall result in the removal of such person's information from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System database. ``(j) New and Material Evidence.--A person or the Federal government may reopen a finally adjudicated case by submitting new and material evidence consistent with this section. ``(k) Court of Competent Jurisdiction Defined.--In this section, the term `court of competent jurisdiction' means the district court of the United States for the district in which the person who is subject to the assessment or determination lives.''. (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of chapter 55 of such title is amended by adding at the end the following new item: ``5511. Conditions for treatment of certain persons as adjudicated mentally incompetent for certain purposes.''. (c) Applicability.--Section 5511 of title 38, United States Code (as added by this section), shall apply, subject to the aforementioned exceptions, with respect to all persons who are determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be mentally incompetent as of the date of enactment. After the date of enactment of this Act, and separate from a finding of mental incompetency, in any case arising out of the administration by the Secretary of laws and benefits under this title, for persons determined to be a danger to self or others, such determination shall be made consistent with section 5511 of title 38, United States Code (as added by this Act). (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section or the amendments made by this section shall be construed to require that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs first determine that a person is mentally incompetent for purposes of assigning a fiduciary before the Secretary may initiate the process to determine whether a person is a danger to self or others, consistent with section 5511 of title 38, United States Code, as added by this section. ______ SA 4858.
