Obama’s Focus in China Is on Leader, Not Public
The amount of time Mr. Obama is willing to lavish on Mr. Xi attests to the power of a single Chinese citizen. Mr. Xi’s status as the nation’s paramount leader has only been enhanced since the two men spent nearly eight hours in discussions in June 2013, strolling amid the cactuses of the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, Calif.

By contrast, the White House played down a brief encounter between Mr. Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the opening ceremony of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum on Monday. The two leaders did not have time to say more than hello, an official said.

The White House is well aware that Mr. Obama’s encounters with Mr. Xi run the risk of looking stage-managed, which is one reason American officials are pushing the Chinese authorities to permit questions when the two men are to deliver public statements on Tuesday.

So far, the answer has been no, and history suggests that will be hard to reverse. Hu Jintao, the former president, did not take questions when he appeared with Mr. Obama in 2009. White House officials insist they have not lost hope: They say they will keep lobbying the Chinese until just before the leaders take the stage.

“If you go back to when Chinese leaders have agreed to joint press availabilities, you’ll have a very hard time finding one where they have been willing to take questions,” said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a former adviser on China in the Clinton administration. “We want it; they don’t. They are the host, and that’s where we end up.”

In Beijing, Mr. Obama appeared determined not to antagonize his host. Asked about Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests, Mr. Obama appealed for restraint, saying that while the United States did not necessarily agree with China about the issues behind the standoff, it did not want to see the tensions erupt into violence.
