Since 2003/04, the Fund supported projects mainly in the areas of education, health, agriculture, roads, security, environment and sports. However, theÃ‚Â NG-CDF (Amendment) Act 2016Ã‚Â Ã‚Â introduces a major shift in the scope of projects eligible for funding. Under this Act only projects falling within the functions of the National Government as outlined in the Constitution of Kenya will be funded.Ã‚Â This effectively means that moving forward, the Fund will concentrate primarily on education, security, sports, environment sectors and other national government residual functions
