China proposes four-step initiative to help solve Syrian crisis

China on Friday urged the international community to take actions, set aside interest conflict and seek a common ground to create conditions for the political settlement of the Syrian crisis.



Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Baodong proposed at the Vienna talks on Syria a four-step initiative to help politically solve the Syrian crisis.



Li said China urged all sides in Syria for an immediate cease-fire with commitment to fighting terrorism.



He suggested that Syria's warring sides, under the auspices of the United Nations, should have comprehensive, inclusive and equal dialogues to make arrangements for political transitions.



Li said that the United Nations should play the role of the main channel of mediation in the Syrian crisis.



He also proposed the start of the reconstruction process in Syria to let the warring sides see the peace dividends once the war ends.



The talks would be resumed in two weeks to push the diplomatic process forward, seeking a solution for ending years of conflict in Syria which has led to humanitarian crisis in the country and migration crisis in EU.
