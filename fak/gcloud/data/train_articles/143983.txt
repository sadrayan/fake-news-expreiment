Event Samuel Beckett, Andre the Giant, and the Crickets - RHINOFEST 2012 Written by Rory Jobst

Directed by Joshua Ellison



While living in rural France, Irish Nobel-winning playwright Samuel Beckett drove his friend's son, Andre Rousimoff, to school, because the 12-year-old boy was too big to fit in the local school bus. This boy would grow up to become the iconic professional wrestler, Andre the Giant. Inspired by a true story, this one-act imagines one particular drive to school, chock full of Beckett's existential absurdities and Andre's zest for life.



Featuring BF Helman and Christopher Marcum
