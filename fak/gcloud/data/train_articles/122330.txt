The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) was conceptualized to monitor the progress of Child Survival,Development, Protection and Participation (CSDPP) Programme as well as to serve as means of datagenerating mechanism for measuring the achievement and gaps in the targets of the millennium developmentgoals (MDGs), particularly as it may affect the children and women. At the World Summit for SocialDevelopment in 1995, the need was also stressed for better social statistics if social development had tomove to centre stage for the cause of the children of the world.The first in the series of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS1) was conducted in 1995 by theFederal Office of Statistics (FOS), now National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), with technical and fundingassistance from UNICEF. Since then, MICS has been institutionalized within the National Integrated Surveyof Households (NISH) in the National Bureau of Statistics, as a process of collecting regular, reliable andtimely social statistics. The second round of MICS was conducted in 1999 with a better strategy for theexecution of the survey from planning to report writing. Expectedly, the current edition of the MultipleIndicator Cluster Survey (MICS3) was better planned, executed and has achieved the aim of providingreliable data for monitoring progress of the Nigerian children and women, and the Millennium DevelopmentGoals.This report would have been impossible without the commitment of UNICEF, which provided technical andfinancial assistance for the project. Worthy of mention also is the significant contribution of the officialsfrom UNICEF, Nigeria, namely: the Representative Mr. Ayalew Abai, Dr. Ahmed El Bashir Ibrahim (Chief,Planning & Communication) and Mr. Johnson Awotunde, M&E Specialist. The National Bureau of Statisticsacknowledges the support and cooperation from all other stakeholders who took part in the project in variousforms. These include the National Planning Commission, the Federal Ministry of Health, the FederalMinistry of Education, the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs, the Federal Ministry of Information andCommunication, the National Population Commission, various Non Government Oganizations. Othersinclude UNDP, DFID, World Bank and the MDG Office.This report is based on the Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, conducted in 2007 by the NationalBureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria with financial and technical support from UNICEF, Nigeria. The surveywhich was Nigeria copy of global MICS3 was a response to the needs to monitor progress towards goals andtargets emanating from recent international agreements including the Millennium Declaration, adopted by all191 United Nations Member States in September 2000, and the Plan of Action of A World Fit For Children,adopted by 189 Member States at the United Nations Special Session on Children in May 2002. Both ofthese commitments build upon promises made by the international community at the 1990 World Summit forChildren.The Federal Government of Nigeria has in recent times launched a number of development initiatives toimprove the economic and social life of its people. The National Programme for the Eradication of Poverty(NAPEP) is concerned with strategies for poverty reduction; the National Action Committee on HIV/AIDS(NACA) has the mandate for planning, implementing and monitoring programmes for control of HIV/AIDS;the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) focuses on wealth creation,employment generation, corruption elimination and general value orientation; the state and local governmentextensions of NEEDS are State Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (SEEDS) and LocalEconomic Empowerment and Development Strategy (LEEDS) respectively. These and other programmesare commitments towards targets as those contained in the Millennium Development Goals.The Federal Government has also expressed strong commitment to, and declared as a matter of high priority,efforts to monitor and evaluate progress towards the attainment of the benchmarks established in thesenational and other global goals. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) with financial and technical supportfrom international development partners and donors like UNICEF has been involved in this effort throughprovision of relevant data to monitor, evaluate and advise necessary adjustments in development policies andprogrammes. The NBS, in recent times had conducted a number of national sample surveys mostly withinglobal generic contexts. The Nigeria Living Standard Survey (NLSS), the General Household Survey (GHS),the Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire Survey (CWIQ) and the 1999 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey(MICS2) are examples. MICS Nigeria 2007 has been designed to measure progress towards achievements ofthe Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and other international targets like the Abuja Declaration onmalaria which are mainstreamed into the above-stated national commitments. Nigeria’s MICS3 is, therefore,bound to improve the country’s data base and provide a valuable tool for evidence-based planning tosurmount its development challenges.More specifically, MICS Nigeria 2007 should assist monitoring and evaluating UNICEF countryprogrammes including those on immunization, vitamin A supplementation, child development, child andwomen rights and protection among others. The survey should also build survey capability and enhance dataanalysis experience at the NBS. This executive summary report presents results on principal topics coveredin MICS Nigeria 2007 expressed in outcome and impact indicators1 that are important for designing,monitoring and evaluating progress of national programmes and provide a means for comparing the situationin Nigeria with that in other countries.2. Survey ObjectivesMICS Nigeria 2007 should provide up-to-date information on the situation of children and women inNigeria, strengthen national statistical capacity by focusing on data gathering, quality of survey information,statistical tracking and analysis, contribute to the improvement of data and monitoring systems in Nigeriaand strengthen technical expertise in the design, implementation, and analysis of such systems. The surveyshould also furnish data needed for monitoring progress toward the Millennium Development Goals, andtargets of A World Fit for Children (WFFC) among others, measure progress towards achievements of thegoals of NEEDS and its state and local government extensions, provide statistics to complement and assessthe quality of data from recent national surveys like Nigeria Living Standard Survey (NLSS), Nigeria CoreWelfare Indicator Questionnaires (CWIQ) and the National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS).1 For more information on the definitions, numerators, denominators and algorithms of Multiple IndicatorCluster Surveys (MICS) and Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators covered in the survey: seeChapter 1, Appendix 1 and Appendix 7 of the MICS Manual – Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey Manual 2005:Monitoring the Situation of Children and Women, also available at www.childinfo.org Sample survey data [ssd]Individual, Household
