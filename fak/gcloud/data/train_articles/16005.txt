My comment:

"No one knows how the Supreme Court of the United States will rule on this issue—or whether it will rule at all. The Court could, for example, decide to have the case re-argued next term or dismiss the writ of certiorari without ruling on the merits. And even if the Court reaches the merits, its ruling may not settle or clarify anything. The laws of Texas are not even before the Court. Texas lawmakers and government officials should not assume that a ruling from the Supreme Court will require any change in the effect or enforcement of our marriage laws.”
