Governor Rick Scott to Kentucky Business Leaders: Book a One-Way Ticket to Florida
Following up from recent letters to Minnesota, Illinois, California, Connecticut, New York and Maryland business owners urging them to book a one-way ticket to Florida, Governor Rick Scott contacted Kentucky businesses last week. Governor Scott is urging them to come to the Sunshine State to take advantage of Florida’s business-friendly environment.

Governor Scott said, “Kentucky’s formula of higher taxes and more spending is not working. Florida has cut over 2,500 regulations, cut taxes 25 times and paid down state debt. As a result, over the past year Kentucky’s unemployment rate remained relatively stagnant while Florida’s has dropped 1.7 percent. Not only is Florida a great place for businesses, but it’s also a great place to get an education, and we will continue to work to bring more jobs and opportunities to Florida families.”
