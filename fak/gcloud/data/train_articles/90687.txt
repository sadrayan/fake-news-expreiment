Cannabis and IQ debate in the media
A Norwegian economist has questioned the findings of a highly publicised New Zealand study which found a causal link between heavy adolescent cannabis use and a decrease in IQ. However, the authors of the original research have backed their conclusions in the ensuing media coverage.

Research published last year, based on data from the Dunedin cohort study, found that the heavy teen cannabis use led to a decrease in IQ. But now economist Ole Rogeberg from the Ragnar Frisch Centre for Economic Research has published an analysis of the study claiming that the the association between teen cannabis use and IQ could be due socio-economic factors the original authors did not account for.

The authors of the Dunedin research have refuted these claims, saying their research does show a causal effect.
