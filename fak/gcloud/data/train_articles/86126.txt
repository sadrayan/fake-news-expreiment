Trump tweets threat to sue over Louisiana delegate share
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump threatened on Sunday (March 27) to file a lawsuit over the number of convention delegates he's being awarded in Louisiana following the state's presidential primary.

In a tweet, he said he won the state but will "get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming."

The billionaire businessman garnered the most votes in Louisiana's Republican presidential primary on March 5 with 41.4 percent of the vote, beating Sen. Ted Cruz, who received 37.8 percent of the vote.

The Wall Street Journal, however, reported that Cruz might ultimately get "as many as 10 more delegates" from Louisiana than Trump. While they each earned 18 delegates on election night, the five delegates previously awarded to Marco Rubio are now up for grabs -- and the Wall Street Journal said they're expected to back Cruz. In addition, the state has five other delegates who are free to back whichever candidate they want, and are also more likely to support Cruz.

There was also news that the Texan's supporters had gained "five of Louisiana's six slots on the three powerful committees that will write the rule and platform" at this year's Republican National Convention.

Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 27, 2016

Few Louisiana Republican officials reached for comment said they heard about Trump's 4:11 p.m. tweet during the Easter afternoon. Lenar Whitney, a former Republican member of the Louisiana House of Representatives in Terrebonne Parish, was with her family during the day and said she did not hear anything about Trump's threat online.

Although Trump did not explicitly say he would sue the state's Republican Party, Louisiana GOP Executive Director Jason Dore said they "will be prepared" if Trump sues them.
