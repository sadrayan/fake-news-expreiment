Emails, Jerry Patterson, March 31-April 1, 2014 From: Selby, Gardner (CMG-Austin) Sent: Monday, March 31, 2014 1:19 PM To: Jerry Patterson Subject: Fresh inquiry for a PolitiFact Texas fact check

Hello again.

I’m writing after reading a news story in the San Antonio Express-News over the weekend stating that you said you were the only statewide elected official to advocate the guest worker portion of the party platform at the 2012 state convention.

Can you elaborate on your statement? We’d like to check it.

Thanks again.

Ain't much to elaborate. I was the only statewide to do that.
