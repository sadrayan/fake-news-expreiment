MPS celebrates making U.S. News Top 10 high schools list
There is no question that individuals on both sides of the abortion debate should agree that children should not suffer needlessly. That is incompatible with a compassionate and civilized society. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act prohibits elective abortions after 20 weeks to protect pain-capable unborn children from excruciating pain.

Several medical specialists testified at a public hearing in the Capitol citing overwhelming evidence by prestigious experts that developing, unborn children are capable of experiencing pain by 20 weeks after conception. According to the Department of Health Services, the most common abortion procedure at five months is dilation and evacuation. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy provided a vivid description: "The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human would: It bleeds to death as it is torn limb from limb."

While medical experts supporting the bill cite evidence and research by fetal pain experts, opponents in the medical community cite a 2005 Journal of the American Medicine Association article that fetal pain does not develop until 29-30 weeks gestation.
