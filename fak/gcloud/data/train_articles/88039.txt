One in 31 Americans Behind Bars, On Probation
Explosive growth in the number of people on probation or parole has propelled the population of the American corrections system to more than 73 million, or 1 in every 31 U.S. adults, according to a 2009 report.

The vast majority of these offenders live in the community, yet new data in the report finds that nearly 90 percent of state corrections dollars are spent on prisons. One in 31: The Long Reach of American Corrections examines the scale and cost of prison, jail, probation and parole in each of the 50 states, and provides a blueprint for states to cut both crime and spending by reallocating prison expenses to fund stronger supervision of the large number of offenders in the community.
