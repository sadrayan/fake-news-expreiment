T his I did not know, they limit their passports!

Seems like a bit too much to me.

T his is something I would have not thought of either. I guess they do not want them going onwards to another country or returning to St. MAARTEN.

o r they just want to get the money owed first?!

Y es, that is a possibility. I am also surprised that they are required to pay for humanitarian evacuation. I don't think all countries require payment for that.

T his has been the policy since the 60's from what I have read. You sign your life away to be rescued by they US government from foreign soil. It is all about repaying your evac cost.

Y ep, the minute you sign that promissory note, they stamp your passport "limited validity". The State Department defines a "limited validity" passport as any passport that last fewer than 10 years. I could not find a definition of limited validity that applies to people who are evacuated. Considering Airlines and Cruise Ships were evacuating people for free, I think this law is stupid.

T he reimbursement is "at the last available non-discounted airfare" which could be significant. While the citizens are stuck and have no options the government seems more like a mule bringing people across the boarder for a price.



I did see a story in the media about this US effort BUT no report that it would cost the citizens significant cash AND their passports. Let's report the whole story not just the warm and fuzzy parts.



I sent a note to NBC news to see if they were interested in letting the viewers know all the facts about this "humanitarian" effort.

S peaking of reporting the "whole story" you left out one key element from the govt website.





"The cost of the loan is based on the price of the last commercial one-way, full-fare (not discounted) economy ticket prior to the crisis"

Travel.state.gov defines a Limited Validity passport as, “…any passport issued with less than full 10-year validity for those 16 years and older and less than 5-years validity for those under age 16.” Basically it’s a temporary passport issued if yours was lost or stolen while traveling abroad, or you have a citizenship, identity, or name documentation deficiency at the point of application. It will get you out the door, but requires you to provide full documentation before you can get your full passport that’s valid for 10 years (5 years for children under 15).
