Austin Homicide Project
About this project

The Austin Homicide Project is an effort by the Austin American-Statesman to document homicides in the City of Austin and Central Texas, and to provide a database of information about the cases so that the community can stay informed. This database is currently tracking homicides since Jan. 1, 2013, including justifiable homicides and cases classified as murders by the Austin Police Department. The project will expand to include other jurisdictions.
