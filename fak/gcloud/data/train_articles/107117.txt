BNP Victory in Brinsworth, Rotherham.
As you will be aware, the British National Party recently visited Brinsworth Manor Junior and Infant School to make parents aware of the pork ban and introduction of Halal food on to the menu.

Well today the British National Party are happy to announce the pork ban has been reversed (also stated in Rotherham advertiser) which is fantastic news for the children of Brinsworth Manor junior and Infant school and concerned parents who were rightly worried about this latest attack on the Indigenous population.

With the help of Yorkshire activist George Edwards, myself and Lacette from the North West Infidels distributed our Leaflets ’Halal meat shame on Britain’ to parents outside the school to make them aware of the barbaric practices that come with religious slaughter (Halal and Kosher).

With support obvious to the school the police were called but we were not deterred.

We continued to highlight and chat with parents who were only too happy to complain to the school governors in wake of this attack on British culture. (One Grandfather was so outraged by the pork ban he aired his views on BBC Radio Sheffield) .

The local councillors have since described the ban on pork as wrong but still think having a Halal alternative to suit all dietary requirements is fine.

The British National Party policy on religious slaughter is an outright ban. Animal rights before religious rights!

Despite the victory on getting pork back on the menu we cannot be complacent as there will be many schools and other institutions that will try implement such rules.

Not on our watch!

It is down to local activists to keep an eye on this in their local area and take action were necessary.

If you're not sure what to do get in contact with the British National Party and we can advise what action to take.

Standing up for the rights of the indigenous population is a duty any Nationalist would do to stop the leftist apologists destroying what we believe in.
