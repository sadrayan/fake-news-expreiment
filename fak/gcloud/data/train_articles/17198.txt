301.45 Annotation That sub. (1m) allows minors found delinquent because of sexual contact to be excused from sex offender registration, but not juveniles convicted of false imprisonment, does not render it unconstitutional. Sub. (1m) creates a narrow exception for sex offenders in cases of factually consensual sexual contact between 2 minors. In contrast, false imprisonment is never consensual and never a crime solely because of age. State v. Joseph E.G. 240 Wis. 2d 481, 623 N.W.2d 137, 99-3248. That sub. (1m) allows minors found delinquent because of sexual contact to be excused from sex offender registration, but not juveniles convicted of false imprisonment, does not render it unconstitutional.

301.45 Annotation Sex-offender registration as a condition of probation for bail-jumping was not authorized by s. 973.09 (1) (a). Bail jumping is not one of the offenses enumerated in the sex-offender registration statutes, ss. 301.45 or 973.048, that permit or require registration, and read-in, but dismissed, sexual assault charges do not bring a case within s. 973.048.

301.45 Annotation The sex offender registry scheme under this section did not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection or due process as applied to the defendant when the underlying crime of which he was convicted, false imprisonment of a minor, lacked a sexual element. The purpose of the statute is to protect the public, specifically children, not to identify individuals guilty of a crime with a sexual element. Because not all defendants convicted of crimes lacking sexual elements pose an inherent danger to children, not all criminal defendants will be required to register. It is reasonable to exempt parents convicted of falsely imprisoning their own children from the reporting requirement. State v. Smith, 316 Wis. 2d 165, 762 N.W.2d 856, 08-1011. The sex offender registry scheme under this section did not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection or due process as applied to the defendant when the underlying crime of which he was convicted, false imprisonment of a minor, lacked a sexual element. The purpose of the statute is to protect the public, specifically children, not to identify individuals guilty of a crime with a sexual element.

301.45 Annotation A person convicted of false imprisonment of a minor is required to register as a sex offender.

State v. Smith, 323 Wis. 2d 377, 780 N.W.2d 90, 08-1011. A person convicted of false imprisonment of a minor is required to register as a sex offender. Although the complaint in this case contained no allegation that the false imprisonment entailed anything sexual, the registration requirements of this section, as applied to the defendant, are constitutional because requiring registration is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. State v. Smith, 2010 WI 16

301.45 Annotation To calculate the disparity of ages required in sub. (1m) (a) 2. in determining if an actor is exempt from registering as a sex offender, the time between the birth dates of the two parties is to be determined. Sub. (1m) (a) 2. was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the defendant. State v. Parmley, 325 Wis. 2d 769; 785 N.W.2d 655, 09-1210. To calculate the disparity of ages required in sub. (1m) (a) 2. in determining if an actor is exempt from registering as a sex offender, the time between the birth dates of the two parties is to be determined. Sub.

Freland, 2011 WI App 80

301.45 Annotation A registrant cannot be convicted of violating sub. (6) for failing to report the address at which he or she will be residing when he or she is unable to provide this information. A registrant is unable to provide the required information when that information does not exist, despite the registrant's reasonable attempt to provide it. However, homeless registrants are not exempt from registration requirements and homelessness is not a defense to failing to comply with the registration requirements. Under sub. (2) (f), the DOC may require a registrant to report to a police station to provide any required information that the person has not previously provided. State v. Dinkins, 339 Wis. 2d 78, 810 N.W.2d 787, 09-1643. A registrant cannot be convicted of violating sub. (6) for failing to report the address at which he or she will be residing when he or she is unable to provide this information.

301.45 Annotation The $100 annual registration fee that sub. (10) imposes on convicted sex offenders does not violate the prohibition in Article I, section 10, of the U.S. Constitution against states' enacting ex post facto laws.
