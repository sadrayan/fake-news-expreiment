TODAY ON UPFRONT -- MIKE: MILWAUKEE'S SURGE IN VIOLENT CRIME. TWO VIEWS ON WHAT'S CAUSING IT, AND HOW TO STOP IT. FIRST, MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE. IS A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE BEING PASSED FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT? THEN, CHIEF JUDGE JEFFREY KREMERS. ARE SENTENCES FOR VIOLENT OFFENDERS TOUGH ENOUGH? PLUS, ON THE ROAD TO 2016 WITH SCOTT WALKER. HIS PITCH TO VOTERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. COVERING THE ISSUES IMPORTANT TO WISCONSIN, THIS IS ""UPFRONT." MIKE: HELLO AGAIN, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME TO "UPFRONT." WE BEGIN TODAY WITH THE DEBATE OVER WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE SPIKE IN DEADLY VIOLENCE IN THE STATE'S LARGEST CITY. HOMICIDES ARE UP NEARLY 200% OVER LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME. LAST WEEK, WE HEARD FROM MILWAUKEE POLICE CHIEF ED FLYNN, WHO WANTS TOUGHER SENTENCES AND TOUGHER GUN LAWS. TODAY, MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, JR., WHO SAYS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THE CITY IS SEEING TODAY ARE GENERATIONAL, AND WILL TAKE A GENERATION TO FIX. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK ON THE PROGRAM. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT STATEMENT. A GENERATION TO FIX WHAT'S GOING ON? SHERIFF CLARKE: WE'VE SEEN THE EMERGENCY OF THE UNDERCLASS, THE SUBCULTURE OF PEOPLE. IT IS NOT THE POOR OR THE GENERAL BLACK POOR. IT'S A SMALL PIECE OF THE POPULATION, A GENERATIONAL SCHOOL PLAYER -- FAILURE, PEOPLE CHRONICALLY UNEMPLOYED. WHERE WE CAN BE BEST SITUATION RIGHT NOW -- SITUATED RIGHT NOW IS BETTER POLICING TO SEPARATE THOSE LAW-ABIDING PEOPLE IN THESE CRIME-RIDDEN AREAS FROM A CRIMINAL PERPETRATOR. MIKE: YOU WOULD SUGGEST -- YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE COPS ON THE STREET. SHERIFF CLARKE: WITHOUT A DOUBT. MIKE: HUNDREDS MORE? SHERIFF CLARKE: AT LEAST. ANYWHERE FROM 300-500. WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING -- I HAVE NOT SEEN AN EFFECTIVE CRIME-FIGHTING STRATEGY PUT FORTH. IF I WERE TO FINANCE THAT AS A TAXPAYER, I WOULD WANT TO SAY, HOW WILL YOU DEPLOY THEM? I WANT TO MAKE SURE I GET MY MONEY'S WORTH. MIKE: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE JUDICIARY ROLE. WHAT PRECISELY IS THE CRITICISM YOU HAVE OF WHAT YOU SEE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM? SHERIFF CLARKE: WE HAVE A SOFT ON CRIME JUDICIARY THAT CONTINUES THIS REVOLVING DOOR FASHION OF PUTTING THESE CAREER VIOLENT CRIMINALS COME A HISTORIES -- WE'VE ALL READ ABOUT IT. THEY CYCLED THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, ARE SLAPPED ON THE WRIST, GIVEN PROBATION, GIVEN A SHORT STAY FOR SERIOUS OFFENSES PER ARMED ROBBERY, SEXUAL ASSAULT, SHOOTING AT PEOPLE. THEY PUT THEM BACK IN DISTRESSED NEIGHBORHOODS TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST. TO CLAIM MORE VICTIMS. MANY WHO ARE BLACK. MIKE: THE CHIEF OF POLICE SAYS I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT SHERIFF CLARKE WOULD BE AGAINST THE NOTION OF HAVING SOMEBODY IN ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF A FIREARM FOR THE SECOND TIME FACE A TOUGHER SENTENCE? SHERIFF CLARKE: OF COURSE. A GREAT POLITICAL STATEMENT. AS HE KNOWS, IT DOESN'T MATTER -- WE HAVE ENOUGH LAWS ON THE BOOKS. WE HAVE INEFFECTIVE SENTENCING. WHEN A PERSON COMES BEFORE THE JUDGE FOR AN ARMED ROBBERY, A BANK ROBBERY LIKE THE GUY WHO SHOT THE TWO-YEAR-OLD, HE GOT A 13 YEAR SENTENCE OF WHICH HE SERVED TWO YEARS AND HE IS PUT BACK IN THE STREETS. WE DON'T HAVE A LAW PROBLEM. WE NEED TOUGHER SENTENCING. HE AND I ARE SOMEWHAT ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE DISH AREA -- JUDICIARY AND ASKING THEM TO END THESE IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING PROJECTS ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF LAW-ABIDING PEOPLE IN MILWAUKEE. MIKE: YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT CHANGING THE CULTURE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE DRAWING A LINK BETWEEN WELFARE PROGRAMS AND DEPENDENCY ON GOVERNMENT AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING TODAY. SHERIFF CLARKE: WITHOUT A DOUBT. WE NEED AN AUDIT OF EVERY ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAM TO DETERMINE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. WE SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THESE ANTI-POVERTY -- POVERTY CONTINUES TO BE ENTRENCHED IN THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE. LOOK AT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM , LOOK AT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE CANNOT FIND MEANINGFUL WORK -- WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ATTRACT JOBS TO THIS AREA? UNTIL WE DO THOSE THINGS ALONG WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT , YOU WILL CONTINUE TO SEE VIOLENCE IN OUR STREETS AND MEAN THESE. -- COMMUNITIES. THE PROGRAMS ARE INEFFECTIVE, WHICH HAS LED TO THE GROWTH OF THE UNDERCLASS. THE UNDERCLASS COMES WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF VALUES. THEY SETTLE DISPUTE WITH VIOLENCE, TAKE PROPERTY AT GUNPOINT, INCITE FEAR AND INTIMIDATION IN NEIGHBORHOODS, HAVING KIDS OUT OF WEDLOCK. FAILURE TO SAY CONSISTENTLY -- STAY CONSISTENTLY IN THE WORKFORCE. WHEN THOSE THINGS COME TOGETHER, IT'S NOT THE CAUSE OF CRIME, BUT THE BREEDING GROUND. THOSE ARE THE RISK FACTORS, THE EMERGENCE OF THIS UNDERCLASS. WE ARE SEEING BEHAVIORS ON DISPLAY. WE NEED TO SHRINK THE SIZE OF THE UNDERCLASS WITH THE THINGS I TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF BETTER SCHOOLS, HOLDING PARENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR RAISING THEIR KIDS SO PEOPLE CAN FIND MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT AND THEN PUT THAT TOGETHER WITH MORE EFFECTIVE POLICING, THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL START TO SEE A DROP, EXTREME DROP IN THE CRIME AND VIOLENCE WE SEE TODAY. MIKE: WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. WE ARE 10 MONTHS AWAY FROM THE PRIMARY IN THE RACE FOR MAYOR. HAVE YOU MADE ANY DECISION ABOUT WHETHER YOU WILL GET INTO THE RACE? ARE YOU GOING TO JOIN THE GROUP OF CANDIDATES? SHERIFF CLARKE: THERE IS A LOT ON THE TABLE. I'M NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE CLOCK TO PUT THE PRESSURE ON ME. MY MESSAGE IS CLEAR. PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET. I WILL MAKE A DECISION THAT IS BEST FOR NOT JUST ME, BUT WHERE I CAN HAVE THE MOST EFFECT IN TERMS OF POSITIVE CHANGE IN MILWAUKEE -- RIGHT NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MIGHT BE. MIKE: CAN YOU DO THAT AS SHERIFF? SHERIFF CLARKE: THAT MIGHT BE . TIME WILL TELL AS WE GO ON, WE WILL TAKE A LOOK. NOTHING IS OFF THE TABLE. I HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE TO GET IN LATE BECAUSE OF MY NAME RECOGNITION AND WOULD HAVE ALREADY DONE HERE. MIKE: ARE YOU LEANING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER? SHERIFF CLARKE: NOT YET. MIKE: NOT ON THIS PROGRAM. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK ON. WHEN WE COME BACK, DO JUDGES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY HERE? DO WE NEED TOUGHER SENTENCING? I'LL ASK MILWAUKEE COUNTY CHIEF JUDGE JEFFREY KREMERS. AND LATER -- THE DEMOCRATIC STATE SENATOR WORKING TO CHANGE HER PARTY FROM WITHIN. THAT'S WHEN "UPFRONT" CONTINUES.
