President to the press on the occasion of the United Nations Day for Women’s

Rights and International Peace (International Women’s Day) of 8 March 2000

(SC/6816),

Recalling also the commitments of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for

twenty-third Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly entitled

“Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the Twenty-First

Century” (A/S-23/10/Rev.1), in particular those concerning women and armed

conflict,

Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United

Nations and the primary responsibility of the Security Council under the Charter for

the maintenance of international peace and security,

Expressing concern that civilians, particularly women and children, account

for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict, including as

refugees and internally displaced persons, and increasingly are targeted by

combatants and armed elements, and recognizing the consequent impact this has on

durable peace and reconciliation,

Reaffirming the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of

conflicts and in peace-building, and stressing the importance of their equal

participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion

of peace and security, and the need to increase their role in decision-making with

regard to conflict prevention and resolution,

Reaffirming also the need to implement fully international humanitarian and

human rights law that protects the rights of women and girls during and after

conflicts,



Emphasizing the need for all parties to ensure that mine clearance and mine

awareness programmes take into account the special needs of women and girls,

Recognizing the urgent need to mainstream a gender perspective into

peacekeeping operations, and in this regard noting the Windhoek Declaration and

the Namibia Plan of Action on Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in

Multidimensional Peace Support Operations (S/2000/693),

Recognizing also the importance of the recommendation contained in the

statement of its President to the press of 8 March 2000 for specialized training for

all peacekeeping personnel on the protection, special needs and human rights of

women and children in conflict situations,

Recognizing that an understanding of the impact of armed conflict on women

participation in the peace process can significantly contribute to the maintenance

and promotion of international peace and security,

agreements, to adopt a gender perspective, including, inter alia:

(a) The special needs of women and girls during repatriation and

processes for conflict resolution, and that involve women in all of the

women and girls, particularly as they relate to the constitution, the electoral system,
