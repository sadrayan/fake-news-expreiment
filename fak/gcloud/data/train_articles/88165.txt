Reviewing the gas utility market

The number of estimated gas distribution main miles has increased to 1.208 million, according to PHMSA.

The number of miles of gas distribution pipeline in the United States is greater than ever before and gas remains the nation’s most popular energy source for home heating, according to government and trade association data.

According to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA), the number of estimated distribution main miles increased from 1.202 million in 2007 to 1.208 million in 2008 (the most recent full year of data available, Table 1).

The estimated distribution number of services also increased from 64.8 million in 2007 to 65.3 million in 2008, according to PHMSA. At the same time, the estimated distribution service mileage increased from 815,072 miles in 2007 to 838,032 miles in 2008 (Table 1).

Data from the American Gas Association (AGA) provides indications of some of the key financial and operational metrics of the nation’s gas utilities. According to the AGA, Southern California Gas Co. led all AGA member companies in terms of total revenues and customers in 2008, with $4.10 billion in total sales revenue and more than 5.4 million customers. Atmos Energy was second in revenues, with $3.98 billion, followed by Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline with $3.52 billion in sales revenues in 2008 (Table 2).

In terms of total sales customers, Pacific Gas and Atmos Energy ranked second and third with 4.31 million and 3.15 million customers, respectively. Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline led all AGA member companies in total sales volumes, with more nearly 386 Bcf sold in 2008. Southern California Gas Co. and Atmos Energy ranked second and third, with over 344 Bcf and 332 Bcf sold, respectively (Table 2).

Operationally, plastic materials provided just over half of pipeline systems for gas utilities in overall miles, accounting for 50.7% of the total (Figure 1). Steel protected coated constituted the next highest percentage at 39.2% of the total (in miles). Steel unprotected bare pipe (4.2%) and various other materials (cast/wrought iron, steel unprotected coated and steel unprotected bare) comprised the remainder of the total.

Regionally, according to AGA data, the East North Central area (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin) has the greatest concentrations of gas utility distribution and transmission systems, with some 286,230 miles at the end of 2008. Other regions included West South Central (257,686 miles – Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas); Mountain (152,305 miles – Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming); followed by South Atlantic (188,189 miles – Delaware, D.C., Florida, Georgia, Maryland, the Carolinas and the Virginias); Pacific (159,622 miles – Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington); West North Central (156,425 miles – Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and the Dakotas); Middle Atlantic (143,033 miles – New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania); ; East South Central (124,079 miles – Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee); and New England (37,405 miles – Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont).

Residential gas market survey

In January, the AGA issued its annual Residential Natural Gas Market Survey, which provides updated information for 2008. The survey provides a unique and comprehensive portrait of the residential natural gas market. Detailed information is presented by state and region, including customers, market share, inventory additions from new homes, and conversions from alternative fuels. AGA says that a total of 64 natural gas utility companies responded to the survey, which is an increase from the 57 utilities that responded to last year’s survey.

The survey found that in the United States, 61% of households, or 68 million customers, have natural gas service. Eighty-four percent of these natural gas customers used natural gas for house heating.

Other findings included:

• Natural gas remained the United States’ most popular energy source for home heating, with a 51% residential market share. Put another way, natural gas heated more homes in the country than all other energy sources combined – electricity was 34%, heating oil seven percent, propane five percent and “other” three percent.

• In 2008, the majority of newly built single-family homes (59%) featured gas heat, down a percentage point from the 60% gas-heat share in 2007. The gas space-heating share of new single-family housing completions exceeded the electric share in all but one region of the country. New gas single-family home completions have exceeded all other energy sources for at least eleven years.

• In the new multi-family housing arena, gas market share for space heating fell to 37% in 2008 from 41% in 2007. When both single- and multi-family units are considered, the gas heating share of new housing completions fell to 53%, compared to 56% the previous year. The overall electric share increased by three percentage points to 45% in 2008.

• Net additions to the number of residential natural gas customers totaled 327,000 in 2008. This represents a 0.5% increase in total customers compared to 2007.

• The 2008 survey results show that roughly 14% of all new natural gas customers came from homes converted from another energy source. The respondents were asked to provide a breakdown of conversions by fuel type. Based on these data, fuel oil conversions to natural gas accounted for 33% of all conversions. Approximately 29% of conversion customers had previously heated with electricity. The respondents were unable to identify the previous heating fuel for 38% of the homes.

• Natural gas water heaters have a 51% market share, while shares for gas cooking and clothes drying maintained their market shares of 35% and 21%, respectively.

• During 2007, almost $5.8 billion went to assist low-income households pay their energy bills or weatherize their homes. Most of the funding came from the federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), with $2.2 billion in normal appropriations and emergency funds. Utilities, both electric and natural gas, accounted for 39 percent ($2.3 billion) of the total in the form of discounts, waivers, forgiveness of arrearages, and weatherization programs. In 2008, LIHEAP funding increased to $2.7 billion.
