A Tribute to James L. McCamy

James L. McCamy (1906-1995) was a professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and my undergraduate adviser when I was a senior (1969-1970). Jim introduced me both to the field of public administration and the topic of government public relations, the latter the subject of his dissertation and first book. The more I heard, the more interested I became. Thanks to his excellent advice, I applied to do graduate work at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School. I earned a Ph.D. in Public Administration and wrote my dissertation on government PR (and Congressional efforts to control it). Jim was the best mentor a person could wish for. He showed me two scholarly paths that I otherwise would never had known about. For me, both subjects became lifelong interests. I am eternally indebted to him.

For those interested in government public relations, I have compiled a bibliography of his writings on that subject (in chronological order):
