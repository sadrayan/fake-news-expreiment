58 candidates sign up for New Hampshire primary
A near-record 58 White House hopefuls - from favored frontrunners to a dark horse running on a pony-heavy platform - have signed up to be on the ballot for the New Hampshire primary.

The filing period for the 2016 primary ended Friday with 30 Republicans and 28 Democrats signing paperwork and paying the $1,000 filing fee.

All but a handful made the trek to the secretary of state's office in person, although a handful filed by mail. Among them was Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, whose paperwork arrived the day before he dropped out of the race on Tuesday.

All but three of the candidates were men. Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republicans Carly Fioriana and Chomi Prag were the only female candidates.

For the 2012 election, 44 presidential candidates from 26 states got on New Hampshire's ballot. The all-time high was 1992, when 61 signed up.

This year's crop included some familiar faces, including Edward O'Donnell of Bridgeport, Pennsylvania. The Democrat is making his seventh run.

"I do this to help people," he said. "The first thing we need is for everyone to treat everyone with love, forgiveness, respect, dignity, mercy, tolerance, chivalry, courtesy and old-fashioned manners."

Perennial candidate and performance artist Vermin Supreme also signed up, wearing his signature rubber boot on his head and touting his plan to provide every American with a pony. Asked about how he'd defeat terrorists, he answered "Hooves on the ground and boots on our heads!"

The primary is expected to be held Feb. 9, but Secretary of State William Gardner hasn't set the date yet.
