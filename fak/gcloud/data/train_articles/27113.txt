CHARGES FILED AGAINST BETO O’ROURKE FOR ACCEPTING ILLEGAL $10 MILLION CONTRIBUTION
Just a week after the Federal Elections Commission slammed Beto O’Rourke for accepting thousands of illegal donations, his campaign has again been charged with accepting an illegal $10 million contribution from the liberal cable news network, CNN.

Libertarian Neal Dikeman filed charges against Beto O’Rourke and CNN for $10 million, saying the network’s town hall, which is supposed to air this Thursday, is nothing more than an hour-long commercial which violates election finance laws.



The charges were filed with the Federal Election Commission.

The complaint filed yesterday with the Federal Election Commission states that because neither Senator Cruz nor Mr. Dikeman is not invited to participate, and O’Rourke is the sole focus, CNN cannot claim the event is a debate. Also, citing several examples, he said the hour-long format with O’Rourke is not typical news coverage given to other candidates. Dikeman said the single candidate town hall is an in-kind donation exceeding the federal contribution limit of $1,000.

Dikeman estimates the value of the media swoon fest to be worth at least $10 million and is aiming to force Congressman O’Rourke to be forced to pay that amount to CNN for its hourlong commercial.



Senator Cruz, for his part has offered to show up to debate O’Rourke to make the event a bona-fide debate.

No word whether CNN or the O’Rourke campaign will accept.
