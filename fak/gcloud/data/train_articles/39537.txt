In the last 6 years, we’ve amassed a wealth of knowledge about the state of small business from our 38 million members and we never cease to be surprised. Here are 16 vital (and surprising) statistics we’ve uncovered about the small business landscape:

1) The SBA defines a small business as an enterprise having fewer than 500 employees

2) There are almost 28 million small businesses in the US and over 22 million are self employed with no additional payroll or employees (these are called nonemployers)

4) Small businesses have generated over 65% of the net new jobs since 1995

5) Approximately 543,000 new businesses get started each month (but more employer businesses shut down than start up each month)

6) 7 out of 10 new employer firms survive at least 2 years, half at least 5 years, a third at least 10 years and a quarter stay in business 15 years or more

7) 52% of all small businesses are home-based

8) There were 22.5 million nonemployer firms in 2011 (up almost 2% from the year before)
