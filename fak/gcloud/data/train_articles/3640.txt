Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton: 9
Senator Clinton sounded the alarm soon after 9/11 that those exposed to the toxic air at and around Ground Zero would suffer health effects from their exposure and would need help in the days, months and years to come.

She led efforts to secure $12 million in December 2001 to establish the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program run by Mt. Sinai, the first program designed to track and monitor the health of 9/11 responders. Senator Clinton worked with her colleagues to secure an additional $90 million to expand the number of workers and volunteers eligible, and successfully helped to restore $125 million in additional funding for long-term medical and mental health monitoring and treatment and workers compensation benefits.

Senator Clinton emphasized that a report released in September by Mt. Sinai shows conclusively that thousands of first responders, workers, volunteers, residents and others suffered mental and medical health problems as a direct result of 9/11. Senator Clinton has underscored that this report confirms the need to expand access to health monitoring and treatment to cover all of those whose health was affected by 9/11.
