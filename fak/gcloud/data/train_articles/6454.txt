AUSTIN – Gov. Rick Perry today announced the award of $1,476,848 to the Office of the Attorney General to assist local law enforcement agencies. The grant is awarded under the federal Byrne Grant Program and distributed by the Governor’s Criminal Justice Division (CJD).

“Local agencies across Texas will gain crucial assistance from the Attorney General’s Office to help our communities better protect its citizens and neighborhoods against predators and crime,” Perry said.

The Attorney General’s Office will aid local law enforcement agencies with investigations of cyber crimes, child pornography, organized crime, fugitives, criminal consumer fraud, public corruption and other criminal activities through this grant.

Byrne Formula Grants improve the criminal justice system’s information and reporting systems as well as support drug abuse prevention, treatment and enforcement programs.

Each year, CJD provides more than $130 million in grants to help Texans at the forefront of the fight against crime. CJD funds a variety of programs for juvenile justice, crime prevention and victim services – all aimed at making Texas a safer place.
