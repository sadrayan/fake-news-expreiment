Hillary Clinton coming to Grand Rapids this summer for Economic Club event
GRAND RAPIDS, MI â€” Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state to President Barack Obama, will attend the Economic Club of Grand Rapids' 26th Annual Dinner this summer.

The Club announced Wednesday that Clinton, a former U.S. senator for New York, will be guest of honor at the Monday, June 17, event in the Steelcase Ballroom of DeVos Place.

Only Economic Club members are able to attend.

Clinton, a Democratic favorite for president in 2016, ended her tenure as Obama's secretary of state earlier this year, returning to private life for the first time in decades.

She joins the list of former secretaries of state and political notables who've either accepted invitations from the Economic Club or visited Grand Rapids in recent years.

Earlier this week, former Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, son of late Sen. Edward "Ted" Kennedy, addressed an Economic Club luncheon about mental health issues.

In May, Henry Kissinger, secretary of state to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, is scheduled to attend a closed-door function for the Club.

Earlier this year, Madeleine Albright, secretary of state to President Bill Clinton, appeared at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum.

Albright was in town to talk about her collection of pins, which were used to communicate diplomatic messages. The pins are on display at the museum until April.

In 2011, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, former secretaries of state to President George W. Bush, visited Grand Rapids.

Former first ladies Barbara and Laura Bush will be in Grand Rapids on April 8.
