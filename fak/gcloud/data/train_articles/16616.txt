Subject: Fresh inquiry for a fact-check

Jamie:

Hello again. I write because I seek data pertaining to the 54-county/Republican voters claim in a story that posted Wednesday.

Also, would you have contact information for the identified group, the New Leadership PAC?

EXCERPT (my bold, underline):

Dyer said the need for a shakeup is simmering across Texas, with the passage of resolutions demanding changes in House leadership by 54 Republican Party county chapters representing more than half the stateâ€™s GOP voters.

THANKS,

County parties act autonomously and are not required to submit resolutions to the state party. Therefore, I do have any list of all relevant resolutions. The best way to get that info would be to contact county chairs individually.
