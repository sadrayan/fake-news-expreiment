What’s Actually in Your Canned Pumpkin Purée?
On the other hand, if you want to be sure the purée you’re using is 100 percent pure pumpkin, you’ve got two options. First, opt for buying the Libby’s brand, which you’ll find on the shelves of most grocery stores. They use a strain of Dickinson pumpkins, with especially creamy flesh, that the company developed themselves. It’s also interesting to note that this variety more closely resembles a butternut squash than the orange pumpkin on your front porch.
