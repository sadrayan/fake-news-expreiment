King Won’t Sign Discharge Petition for ‘Clean’ CR
Representative Peter King (R., N.Y.), a vocal critic of the GOP’s conservative wing, has publicly said he would back a “clean” funding bill to end the government shutdown. But he will not back an effort from House Democrats to force a vote on one.

King told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace that he would not sign a Democratic “discharge petition” that would automatically bring a clean CR to the floor — only a handful of Republicans’ signatures would be required to reach the 218-vote majority.

“It’s not going to go anywhere,” King said of the discharge petition. “Democrats are not bargaining in good faith.”

President Obama “has an obligation to get involved” and negotiate with Republicans, he said.
