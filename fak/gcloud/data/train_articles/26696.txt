Commuter tax has driven jobs out of the city
But if a commuter tax is such a good idea, why do so few cities have one?

It's simple: Most states, including New York, don't allow it.

And why do some cities that do have the tax, including Cleveland and Detroit, seem to be struggling?

Well, some economists say the tax (if high enough) can harm a city by discouraging job creation.

Paul Gessing, former policy director of the National Taxpayers Union, a Virginia-based budget-watchdog group, once called Philadelphia "the prototypical example of a city that has been irreparably harmed by steep commuter taxes."

Robert Inman, a municipal-finance expert at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, says the tax has helped push a lot of jobs out of the city and into the suburbs.

Unlike the city's resident wage tax, which is based on where a person lives, the commuter levy is a tax on jobs. Consider how it affects any Philadelphia firm.

To recruit employees who live and work outside the city - or to transfer workers from suburban branches - a company often must hike salaries to offset the tax. (It's less of an issue for New Jersey residents; their commuter tax is credited against state taxes.)

And the commuter tax is no small consideration for a firm's executives, if they live in the Pennsylvania suburbs.

The problem is easily avoided: Shift operations outside the city limits.

Lots of jobs have left over the years, although the commuter tax is hardly the only reason. And don't expect any dramatic change in the tax anytime soon.

The city, which has been trimming the wage tax for everyone since 1995, plans to cut the commuter rate more slowly than the resident rate from here on.

So although both rates figure to decline gradually in the years to come, the commuter rate will almost surely be the nation's highest for a very long time.
