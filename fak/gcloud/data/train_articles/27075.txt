Sheriff Joe for Senate
We cannot sit idly by while our nation faces unprecedented challenges. President Trump needs my help in the Senate. He needs a conservative vote he can count on, and a voice in the Senate who knows first hand the threats our nation is dealing with.

That's why I'm running for The United States Senate.

I know this isn't going to be easy, but I can't in good conscience sit back in retirement knowing that my grandchildren will inherit a country worse off than the America I've spent my entire life defending. I pray to have your continued support today of my campaign.
