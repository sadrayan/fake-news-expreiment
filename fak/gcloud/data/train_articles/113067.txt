Evolution of a majestic peak



This painting by W. Alexander was based on the first known sketch of the mountain by John Sykes, an illustrator on Vancouver's 1792 expedition.

 75,000 years ago: The mountain probably reaches its present size.

 6,600 to 5,700 years ago: Violent explosions cause mudþows that diminish the mountains bulk.

 1841: Lt. Charles Wilkes, in charge of the U.S. Exploring Expedition, triangulates Mount Rainier and comes up with a height of 12,330 feet  more than 2,000 feet too low. His failure to correct for the curvature of the Earth, atmospheric refraction and the height of his instrument above sea level probably accounted for the error.

 1853: The Longmire family arrives in Yelm from Fountain County, Ind. Their group is the first to cross the Cascades north of the Columbia River.

 1856: A U.S. Coast & Geodetic Survey calculates Rainiers height at 14,444 feet, but the surveyors arent sure of the figure and dont publish the information until 1888.

Despite a ruling by the U.S. Board of Geographic names three years earlier, this 1893 guide book continues to refer to the mountain as "Tacoma".

 1890-91: With help of Indian laborers, the Longmires clear a crude wagon road from Ashford to the springs. They build the mountain's first hotel, Mineral Springs Resort.

 1891: First dog climbs the mountain  a deerhound belonging to Dr. Warren Riley, who accompanied Van Trump.
