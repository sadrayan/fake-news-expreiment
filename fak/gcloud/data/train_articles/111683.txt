One of the key economic forums in Russia kicked off earlier in the day in the Crimean city of Yalta and will feature multiple discussions on the economy of the region and possible development and growth strategies.

Crimea seceded from Ukraine and rejoined Russia in March 2014, after a referendum determined that almost 97 percent of the region's population was in favor of the move. The referendum was held after the February 2014 coup in Ukraine.
