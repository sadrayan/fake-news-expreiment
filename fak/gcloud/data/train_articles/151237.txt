NRA Endorses Screnock for State Supreme Court
Fairfax, Va.—The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) is proud to endorse Judge Michael Screnock for the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

“Judge Screnock is a committed judge who will interpret the Constitution the way our Founding Fathers intended,” said Chris W. Cox, chairman, NRA-PVF.

Screnock is one of three running for the current opening on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The primary will be held Feb. 20 and the top two candidates who receive the most votes will be on the April 3 general election ballot.

Screnock, an avid hunter and outdoorsman, was the only candidate seeking election to return a position statement indicating his support for constitutional rights. His opponents refused to return a candidate position statement.

“It’s important that all pro-Second Amendment voters get to the polls on Feb. 20 and elect Judge Michael Screnock to the state Supreme Court,” Cox concluded.
