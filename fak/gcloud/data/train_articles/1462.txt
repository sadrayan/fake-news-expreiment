Florida Gov. Rick Scott proposes $4.6 billion in budget cuts
TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Rick Scott proposed an austere $65.8 billion spending plan Monday that levies deep cuts to classroom spending and privatizes social services in order to afford $1.7 billion in tax cuts for property owners and corporations.

Scott, unveiling his budget before an invited crowd of mostly tea party activists in Eustis, received rousing ovations as he outlined the basics to about 1,000 people gathered inside the First Baptist Church, and another 500 or so spilling into meeting rooms and outside.

He called his budget "Florida's first jobs budget" and declared that it fulfilled his campaign promises to lower taxes, cut spending and "hold government accountable."

"This is the budget you asked for," Scott told the crowd.

By contrast, it was immediately denounced by teachers and other public-employee unions, as well as state Democratic chairman Rod Smith, who called it "a frontal assault on the quality of life of every Floridian" that "will not create a single job nor spur our economy forward."

The plan was presented in a 167-page, broad-brush document that leaves most of the details for lawmakers to flesh out during the legislative session that starts March 8. But it calls for reducing overall spending by $4.6 billion compared to the current fiscal year and reducing the state workforce by 8,681 employees, or nearly 7 percent. Scott said about 2,000 of those positions were unfilled.

Pre-K through university budgets — which Scott had pledged to protect during his campaign — would face $3.3 billion in cuts, dropping from $22.4 billion this year to $19.1 billion. For public schools, per-pupil spending would fall by about $700, a cut that would be partially offset by Scott's push to require all teachers to begin contributing 5 percent of their earnings to their pensions. Those dollars are currently paid for by the local districts and state.
