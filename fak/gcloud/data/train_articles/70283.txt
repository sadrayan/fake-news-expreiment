Pentagon delays sending furlough notices to civilian workforce

3/21/2013 - WASHINGTON (AFNS) -- Pentagon officials have put off sending furlough notices to civilian employees until they've had a chance to analyze how pending legislation that would fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year will affect the Defense Department.



Officials now estimate that furlough notices will go out on or about April 5, Navy Cmdr. Leslie Hull-Ryde, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said.



"The legislation could have some impact on the overall number of furlough days, but no decisions have been reached, especially since the legislation hasn't been signed into law," Hull-Ryde said. "The number of furlough days at this point remains at 22."



Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said the delay makes sense.



"We believe the delay is a responsible step to take in order to assure our civilian employees that we do not take lightly the prospect of furloughs and the resulting decrease in employee pay," he said.
