Pakistani PM Imran Khan says, “Jesus Christ Never Existed”
Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan openly said “Jesus Christ never Existed in human history.” which landed him in hot waters as it was a clear damage to the sentiments of Christians.

To make the situation even worse, Imran khan said these words at a conference for the celebration of none other than the Prophet Muhammad PBUH. At start Pakistani Prime minister Imran khan was praising the Muslim Prophet PBUH, but all of a sudden Imran Khan decided to dive deep in the history and said;

You will find the mention of Moses in history, but you will never find the mention of Hazrat Isa [Jesus Christ] in human history.

The video was broadcasted live on the national TV which shocked the audience all around the world on his remarks on Jesus Christ.

People took twitter and told Imran khan that Jesus christ has been mentioned multiple times in the Holy Quran.

On #EidMiladUnNabi, on International SeeratulNabi conference,

Imran Khan, Prime Minster of 🇵🇰 says that there is no mention of Jesus Christ(Hadrat Eesa)in any books of history

Was he high again or an ignorant fool?

Senator Tariq Hussain Mushhadi wrote on twitter that Jesus is more written in the human history.

There has to be some limit to ignorance.Jesus Christ is by far the most mentioned both verbally & written individual in history. His life & teachings have been taught, researched,discussed, studied,learnt,revered & he is most worshipped & influential than any personage in history — Senator T Mashhadi (@SenatorMashhadi) November 20, 2018

Meanwhile, on the other side, PM Imran khan was bashed for saying these words after being a leader of a Muslim Majority country. And these types of sentiments indeed hurt the Christians living all around the world.

I can’t believe it.Forget abt human history he hasn’t even read quran as prophet Essa Jesus elah-e-salam is most talked abt after prophet Muhammad PBUH. Our religion does not allow us to talk about any prophet like this. The reverence & stature of hazmat Jesus/Essa doesn’t allow — fauzia yazdani (@yazdanifauzia) November 20, 2018

(4): If you Mr. @ImranKhanPTI are not aware of history then kindly stop issuing such silly statements. And yes you should apologize to the entire Christian community for making these mindless remarks.https://t.co/fJmVsVocDy — Suleman Khairullah (@Suleman_ahmad) November 21, 2018

Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek e Insaaf (PTI) followers came out in the support of Pakistani PM Imran Khan. In his defense these people claimed that the clip was taken out of context.
