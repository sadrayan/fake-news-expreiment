Prince William will be at the FA Cup Final on the day of the ROYAL WEDDING
Football chiefs met last week to discuss how the second-in-line to the throne, who is expected to be Harry’s best man when he marries Meghan Markle on May 19, can still present the coveted trophy later that afternoon.

An insider revealed: “The plan is for Prince William to be there. Because the couple are getting married at noon and then not reconvening until later in the evening, there is time for William to make the 5.30pm kick off, and present the trophy before returning to Windsor, probably by helicopter to ensure that he doesn’t miss anything. As far as the FA is concerned, he’s going to be at the FA Cup final.”

Kensington Palace has so far refused to confirm that William will make the crunch match, merely pointing out that the two events “will not clash”.

A spokesman did not respond to a request for comment last night. William, 35, is president of the FA and usually attends the Wembley showpiece, handing the historic silver cup to the winning team.
