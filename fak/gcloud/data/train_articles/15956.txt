Without doing a record-by-record search, there is no way to determine exactly how many students were admitted under the automatic admission law by supplying a sufficiently high ACT or SAT score in lieu of completing the state’s recommended or distinguished achievement course loads. But we can very confidently say the number is miniscule.

Here's why: The Recommended and Advanced Diplomas require Algebra II — so we know anyone who presents us with those credentials has taken Algebra II. That includes nearly 100 percent of our admits from Texas public schools. Overall, it includes 89 percent of all of our admits from Texas. And for those 11 percent who have no identified diploma type, many are graduates of private schools which certify that their graduation requirements meet or exceed the Recommended Diploma.

Because nearly all of our admits from Texas have a Recommended or Advanced Diploma (or private school equivalent), we know nearly all of them took Algebra II.

On the timeline for Top 10, the legislation was approved by the Legislature in 1997. It was amended in 2009 to place a 75 percent cap on the number of entering freshman at UT Austin who can be admitted under the rule. Here's how that has translated for who gets automatic admission since then:

Summer/fall 2010 & spring 2011 applicants § Class rank to be automatically admitted: Top 10% Summer/fall 2011 & spring 2012 applicants § Class rank to be automatically admitted: Top 8% § Notification to Texas educators: September 2009 Summer/fall 2012 & spring 2013 applicants § Class rank to be automatically admitted: Top 9% § Notification to Texas educators: September 2010 Summer/fall 2013 & spring 2014 applicants § Class rank to be automatically admitted: Top 8% § Notification to Texas educators: September 2011 Summer/fall 2014 & spring 2015 applicants § Class rank to be automatically admitted: Top 7% § Notification to Texas educators: September 2012
