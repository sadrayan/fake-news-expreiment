If Trump is the Republican nominee, what would it take for Cruz not to support him?

In recent days, Sen. Ted Cruz has said that if Donald Trump were the Republican nominee, it would be "catastrophic" for the country and the Republican party, and the election would be handed to Hillary Clinton. Cruz has said that Trump's campaign "affirmatively encourages violence" and "disrespects voters."

Despite all this, Cruz has maintained that he will support Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee. But apparently there is a scenario where Cruz would abandon the businessman.

"If, for example, he were to go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, I would not be willing to support Donald Trump," Cruz said in Rockford, Ill., on Monday.

In January, Trump said he could "stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters," as he turned his fingers into the shape of a gun.

Cruz, as he has said for the past few weeks, reiterated that the only way to beat Trump is by voting. He again dismissed the idea of a brokered convention, arguing that it would spark a "revolt" from voters.

"The answer is not to cry in your beer about the support Donald has received," Cruz said. "The way to beat Donald Trump is to beat him at the ballot box."

Cruz is making five stops in Illinois today and railed against its politicians and political culture. Cruz said Trump gave $7,000 to former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was later convicted of corruption charges, and $50,000 to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.
