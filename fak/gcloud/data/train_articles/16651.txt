Subject: Urgent inquiry for PolitiFact Texas fact-check

I write because we’re fact-checking Sean Hannity’s statement on his March 7 program that 642,000 crimes were committed against Texans by criminal immigrants in a recent seven-year period.

State data we’ve reviewed before indicate that his figure reflects a count of arrests, not convictions, in the lifetimes of immigrants arrested in that 7-year period (not all of them living in the U.S. without legal permission). Also, a big share of of the tallied offenses were non-violent.

We’re interested in hearing from Hannity about how he reached his specific conclusion. For all our stories, we count on attributable on-the-record information. We hope to complete this fact-check by midday Wednesday.

Thanks,

g.

Sean sat in on a briefing with the Border Patrol. This is the soundbite:

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Criminal aliens have been responsible for about 642,000 offenses, criminal offenses. You look up there in the top left, sexual assaults, there's close to 8,000 victims.

HANNITY: Six hundred and forty-two thousand crimes since --

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In 2008.

HANNITY: In Texas alone?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Over 200,000 individuals with a criminal history, they committed over 642,000 crimes.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the cost of not securing the border.
