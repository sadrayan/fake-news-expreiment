Lance Statement on Tax Reform Vote
WASHINGTON, D.C. --- Congressman Leonard Lance (NJ-07) released the following statement on the tax reform bill that passed in the U.S. House.

“I voted against the tax bill today because it significantly reduces the ability of New Jerseyans to deduct state and local taxes, a provision that has been in the code since 1913. Also, as a deficit hawk, I do not favor adding $1.5 trillion to the national debt. I was pleased, however, that the Conference Committee improved the bill in several ways, including provisions for extraordinary medical expenses and student debt and graduate tuition.”
