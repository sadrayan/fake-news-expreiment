Spot Report by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine: Shot fired close to SMM near Kalynove
At about 09:00 on 3 February 2017, as an SMM patrol approached a position of the so-called “LPR” near Kalynove (60km west of Luhansk), it saw three armed men in military-style uniform about 30m away. One of the men was kneeling and pointing an automatic rifle (AK-type) in the direction of the SMM. An infantry fighting vehicle (BMP-1) was parked next to the armed men. As the SMM left the vehicles it heard one shot from a rifle, assessed as coming from the direction of the armed men. The SMM immediately returned to the vehicles and left the area. The incident lasted about one minute. No SMM members were injured. The SMM informed the JCCC.
