Global Report on out-of-school children
Adolescents twice as likely to be out of school as primary school-age children say UIS and UNICEF

New report shows why ‘business as usual’ won’t lead to universal primary or secondary education

Around 63 million adolescents between the ages of 12 to 15 years are denied their right to an education according to a new joint report from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and UNICEF, "Fixing the Broken Promise of Education for All – Findings from the Global

Initiative on Out-of-School Children". The report and related data tool were sponsored by the Global Partnership for Education.



Globally, one in five adolescents is excluded from the classroom, compared to one in 11 primary school aged children. So, adolescents are twice as likely to be out of school as their younger counterparts. The report shows that, as children get older, the risk that they will never start school or will drop out increases.

In total, 121 million children and adolescents have never started school or dropped out despite the international community’s promise to achieve universal primary education by 2015. Data show that there has been almost no progress in reducing this number since 2007. Children living in conflict, child labourers and those facing discrimination based on ethnicity, gender and disability are the most marginalised. There is also a growing concern that previous gains in expanding access to education will erode without a major shift in policies and resources. If current trends continue, 25 million children – 15 million girls and 10 million boys -- are likely to never set foot inside a classroom.
