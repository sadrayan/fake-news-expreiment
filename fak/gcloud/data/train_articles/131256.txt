SPREAD THIS! Starbucks new promo!!! #refugeeswelcome : The
It means that nearly all companies have people that do nothing but sit around all day, 40 to 60 hours a week, thinking about ways to promote the brand and increase sales.

Most of these people are VERY smart, VERY educated and have a lot of experience.

Usually, there are think tanks that meet everyday to come up with promotions and marketing efforts that equate to building the business, and to be honest with you, keeping their jobs...as this is what they are hired to do.

They are, for lack of a better word, "sluts".

Why sluts? Because they will use any means and say just about anything, tactfully and strategically, if they think it will work.

They don't care about anything other than if it means a short and/or long term effect on sales. Even a room filled with hard core right wing Trump supporting republicans, will do stuff like this if they think it will help.

It also means that they spent a lot of time crafting it. Working over the words, the idea, and most likely even tested with consumers locally or in a smaller group before releasing it nationally.

Most commoners/consumers have NO IDEA how much effort is put into sucking on people's brains to get them to do something. Even the people in this sub that see this, even with disgust, are still now more likely to go out and purchase a Starbucks product today.

If the flavor of the day, week, month or year is, "support the refugees" OR "support the troops" or "gay pride"...or whatever, they will find a way to promote it and make money from it.

And, people...the buying public, fall for it, hook, line and sinker.

This is just what most would say is "good business". Or smart business. Often the difference between those companies that succeed and those that fail, are how aggressive the sales and marketing efforts are. Hence one of the reasons why so many successful companies are started and run by marketing and sales guys.
