Phoenix Fire says capacity rules not broken after Trump tweets officials broke fire code
PHOENIX - After a large crowd of Donald Trump supporters and protesters flooded into downtown Phoenix Saturday, some raised concerns of safety.

The original venue had to be changed due to public interest and Trump himself addressed the "thousands" of people stuck outside the Phoenix Convention Center during his sold-out campaign rally.

Trump tweeted Sunday morning that city officials "don't want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in the 4,000 code room" on Saturday.

He followed the statement by another tweet stating that the convention center allowed everyone to come inside so they wouldn't be left outside in the heat.

Phoenix Fire Department says City of Phoenix Fire Prevention Specialists set the capacity for the room at 4,200 people.

The fire department reportedly closed the doors once they reached capacity.

"No rules or codes were broken and no one was in danger at any time," Deputy Chief Shelly Jamison says.

According to Phoenix Fire, a Fire Prevention Specialist is an expert on large events and are assigned to specifically enforce large-capacity events such as Comicon, Super Bowl Fan Fest, rallies and other.
